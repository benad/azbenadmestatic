                    <p>So, why the nickname "Benad"? Well, to explain that, I first need
            to start with the ethymology of my real name, Benoit
            Nadeau.</p>
                            
                    <h3>Benoit Nadeau</h3>
                                
                    <p>My first and last name are unusual. Yes,
            here in Qu&eacute;bec, both the given name "Benoit" and the surname
            "Nadeau" are quite usual.</p>
                                
                    <p>
                        To put things in context, in Qu&eacute;bec many women would simply
            keep their surname after marriage, which would save paperwork
            and confusion after divorce. To avoid "sexism", or fights,
            parents would often would give <i>both</i> their unchanged
            surnames to their kids. Of course, the order of such compound
            surname could be the source of a fight too, and no one properly
            thought ahead of what would happen in the next generation.
                    </p>
                                
                    <p>So, for me, I got my mother's surname, "Benoit", and my
            father's surname "Nadeau". And since "Benoit" can be both a
            surname and given name, it became my given name. Don't worry,
            my sibblings only got "Nadeau" as surnames, keeping a bit of
            "tradition"...</p>
                            
                    <h3>The Circumflex Accent</h3>
                                
                    <p>But then, I'm not totally forthcoming about my name.
            Officially, my name is "BENOIT JEAN LOUIS-OLIVIER NADEAU",
            written with a cheap typewriter at the mayor's office. Years
            later, that was "translated" officially to "Beno&icirc;t Jean
            Louis-Olivier Nadeau". Notice that circumflex accent (the accent
            "^") on the "i" that just appeared out of nowhere.</p>
                                
                    <p>Well, I personally don't care about the circumflex accent,
            even though officially I was given one by the
            government. Why? Well, a bit of ethymology about the name "Benoit".
            </p>
                                
                    <p>"Benoit" is an old Latin name that dates back to the 13th
            century, from the word "benedictus", or "blessed". Its original
            French form was "Benoist", which sounds like "buh-no-east".
            Later, the "s" became silent, so it sounded like "buh-no-it". To
            separate the vowels "o" and "i" in the sound, a circumflex
            accent was added on the "i". In modern French though the name
            now sounds like "be-n-wa", so eventually the accent will be
            dropped altogether, but depending of use (given versus surname,
            lineage, region, etc.) the accent remains. And that's what
            the government "guessed".</p>
                                
                    <p>
                        So, let me be clear: officially it's "Beno&icirc;t", usually it's
            "Benoit", and it sounds like "be-n-wa". And I quickly learned
            from Anglophones that have no knowledge of French that they would
            almost always say "ben-oy-t", which sounds horrible, so I had
            to do <i>something</i>...
                    </p>
                            
                    <h3>Benad</h3>
                                
                    <p>The "compromise" for Anglophones in the form of "Benad" came
            as an unintended consequence of me trying to figure out what my
            Internet nickname should be.</p>
                                
                    <p>It was still the early 90s when I realized of the importance
            of the name you give to yourself for your "main" online
            personality. More than that, I forsaw that finding a unique
            name would just be harder over time as everybody became more
            "connected".</p>
                                
                    <p>So, I connected the first three letters of my given name to
            the first three letters of my surname. And it sounded good in
            English. So I kept it.</p>
                                
                    <p>Well, it's still not totally unique since "Benad" is a real
            given name. But if I'm lucky enough, nobody registered it before I
            do.</p>
                                
                    <p>And what about the "84" I add when somebody else already
            registered "benad"? No, it's not my birth year (I wish). It's
            because the novel "1984" was one of the first English novel I've
            read, so I kept using "84" as a suffix.</p>
