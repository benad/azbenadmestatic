                        This is not a proper biography <i>per se</i>, since most personal
            stuff is left out. Here is more about things of my past that might
            be of interest to the general public.
                    </p>
                            
                    <h3>The Age of Music</h3>
                                
                    <p>My early childhood is, outside the confines of my family home,
            relatively un-eventful, until the middle of the first grade of elementary
            school. After an odd "auditory test", where students would be asked
            to compare the pitch of music notes, my parents were presented with
            two choices about my academic future. The first was, given my early
            academic results, to skip two years of school directly to grade 4.
            Since I was already the smallest student in first grade, such
            prospect, in a public school, would have been physically hazardous
            for me. The second was for me to start attending a public school for
            academically and musically gifted students. Feeling my boredom and fear
            of retribution from taller students, my parents obviously chose the
            latter choice.</p>
                                
                    <p>From then, I spent roughly half of my school time learning and
            playing music, and so on until the end of high school. My
            specialization was the violin. That always was quite a physical
            challenge due to its unforgiveness and my lack of precise finger
            movement. I since then stopped playing music, with some regret.</p>
                                
                    <p>
                        Yet, beyond the theory and the endless hours of physical
            practice and pain, I learned from music many things that shaped me.
            Such things are difficult to describe here, but suffice to say that
            whatever would interest me from then on, I would be <i>artful</i>
            at it.
                    </p>
                            
                    <h3>Discovering a Talent</h3>
                                
                    <p>It is difficult to say with humility that you are genuinely
            talented at something. But if you are, regardless of how much effort
            it would take to grow in such talent, that domain always feels
            easy and natural. For me, it was anything related to computer
            software.</p>
                                
                    <p>
                        Early on, my mother discovered that "gadgets" would fascinate me.
            Discovering how a tool of object works would fill me with passion,
            that is until I understood of it worked. The problem though was with
            my overall clumsiness with physical objects (which also affected my
            learning of violin). But with software, learning was
            <i>limitless</i> and unaffected by physical akwardness.
                    </p>
                                
                    <p>
                        Me and my mother will always remember my first encounter with a
            <i>Macintosh</i> computer. Busy at work and with no access to a
            babysitter, she knew that I was old enough to "take care of myself"
            in her office while she went teaching at the university for the
            next hour or so. The
            only piece of "entertainment" was a Macintosh computer with the
            "Mac Draw" software loaded and the general instruction "have fun
            drawing pictures". And, without any instruction or prior training,
            so did I. And played with the system settings. And, out of many
            things, changed the desktop pattern, which was the only thing I
            haven't properly reverted before she came back. Which prompted
            my mother to ask me how I did it.
                    </p>
                                
                    <p>Unlike the other "PCs" I've seen after, nothing felt as intuitive
            and limitless as a Macintosh. While this was true for most people,
            for me this meant I would learn about the software easily and
            at a high pace.</p>
                            
                    <h3>A Proper Profession</h3>
                                
                    <p>
                        Now then, there isn't anything special about being good at
            <i>using</i> software. Understanding how it
            works, maybe. Reverse-engineering it, maybe a bit more.
            But developing good software based on a deep
            understanding and appreciation for high quality software, now that's
            difficult. So being talented enough to design and develop <i>great</i>
            software in a way that seems, to the casual observer, both easy and
            "like magic", now <i>that's</i> something special enough to be
            considered a talent. But how can you know if you have such talent
            in something?
                    </p>
                                
                    <p>It took quite a leap of faith to try, on my own and with limited
            understanding of the English language, "real" programming before
            finishing college. And even up to the end of the 90s, "programmers"
            were not as such in high demand as it is now. But after some
            practice, I could say that I liked it and was good enough to
            potentially make software development a lifelong profession, even
            without high demand or high pay.</p>
                                
                    <p>
                        So I was surprised to see this "information age" arrive so fast,
            and lucky enouch to be in a profession with such high demand.
            Even if I were to be lazy and just coast off my talent, I <i>like</i>
            writing good software, even more when other people can appreciate
            it. So even with talent, I'm still a slave to my "art".
                    </p>
                            
                    <h3>The Rest</h3>
                                
                    <p>
                        What happened during University and later is, unless I become a
            celebrity of some kind, unworthy of much attention. Suffice to say
            that while my life is sometimes very difficult, it is still
            relatively <i>cozy</i>. Enough for me to have the time to write
            this.
                    </p>
                                
                    <p>This is when one would normally think about what kind of
            achievements would define their life. Or what one would like to
            experience before death.</p>
                                
                    <p>
                        But I don't. <i>Toughtful passion</i> simply drives me.
                    </p>
                                
                    <p>... Or something pretentious like that.</p>
