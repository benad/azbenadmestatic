        <div class="span8 offset2">
                <p>Apple finally updated their <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/27/apple-unveils-new-macbook-pros/">MacBook Pros</a>, and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13548052/the-macbook-pro-lie">professionals weren&rsquo;t impressed</a>. Last time, with the late 2013 model, they reduced the number of ports, but having bought one I managed to live with it using a few dongle adapters. While I like that they moved to USB-C, I am annoyed that they moved to <em>solely</em> USB-C, since I would have to buy a new set of dongles, let alone the USB-A to USB-C adapters for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; USB devices. Beyond that, the specs are average for the price, and the &ldquo;touch bar&rdquo; has little to no use for a developer that frequently use the function keys.</p>

<p>All that being said, I&rsquo;m not planning to buy a new laptop until roughly a year from now. In the meantime, it does raise the question about if MacBook Pros, let alone macOS in general, is what I need for my programming work. Each time I upgrade macOS I have to <a href="https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration">recompile countless packages</a> from <a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, to the point where I realize that almost all of my work is done on command-line tools easily available on Linux. I have to constantly run a Windows 7 virtual machine, so having Windows 10 in that strange BootCamp + Parallels Desktop setup doesn&rsquo;t seem to be necessary.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m seriously considering buying a Linux laptop as my next programming laptop. Something like the <a href="http://www.dell.com/ca/business/p/xps-13-9360-laptop/pd">New XPS 13 Developer Edition</a>, the one that comes with <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, would be nice, and hopefully by next year they fix that annoying coil noise. If I feel adventurous I might take a typical <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki">ThinkPad</a> with well-known components supported in Linux and install Linux myself. Yes, I get the irony that a &ldquo;Mac guy&rdquo; would buy what used to be an IBM laptop. Either way, I might both save money (even more in the former since I don&rsquo;t pay for Windows), and potentially time, since most of my development tools would be easy to set up. I might still have to buy some dongle for an Ethernet network connection if I get a thinner laptop, though interrrestingly both my DisplayPort DVI adapter and Thunderbolt Ethernet from Apple adapters may still work. Or I could even go with a thicker &ldquo;portable computer&rdquo; (like the ThinkPad P50) and use a docking connector, the 90s solution to dongles&hellip; In fact if I&rsquo;m willing to let go of thinness and battery life, like I did with my first 17&rdquo; MacBook Pro, I&rsquo;d be able to get more storage and 32 GB of RAM.</p>

<p>I should admit that I have no experience with a Linux laptop or desktop, in the context of one attached to a display for day to day use. All my Linux systems were either &ldquo;headless&rdquo; or running in virtual machines, so I can&rsquo;t tell if dealing with Xorg configuration files is going to be difficult or not. Same thing can be said for multiple displays, Bluetooth mice, and so on. But from what I&rsquo;ve read, as long as I stay away from smaller ultrabooks I should be OK.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to stop using Macs for home use, though the price increases may restrict my spending on a well-needed upgrade to my mid-2011 Mac mini. Home use now seems the natural fit for Macs anyways. Long gone is the business-oriented Apple from the mid-90s.</p>
