                <p>In lieu of the usual annual resolutions, this year I made use of some of those vacation days to plan for what programming languages I will learn in the following months. In the past few years, I learned Python, Erlang and D, but sadly I couldn't come up with any excuse to use them in a programming project, be it at home or at work.</p>

<p>A factor that I glossed over when choosing a programming language is its usefulness in the "work market", be it my current work, seeking a new job, or even self-employment. Another factor is what other non-programmers expected out of me. And, of course, being a user of many Apple products, people wonder when they'll see my iPhone App.</p>

<p>I did learn a little bit of Objective-C about a decade ago, at the beginnings of Mac OS X. I did some very basic "Cocoa" desktop development, though back then the programming environment for it was more NextStep's than Apple's. Since then, I focused so much on UNIX, Linux and server-side development that it felt weird to be using a Mac yet forgot how to write desktop software for it.</p>

<p>Unlike Erlang and D, there are surely tons of books for iOS development, and a few for Mac. I will have a shock using the latest XCode, but I can deal with that. While Mac development is unrestricted, my greatest worry is about iOS', with its restrictive API and closed App Store. Do I need to have a corporation to publish an App? Will it be restricted to the Canadian store? If I want to place ads in the App, how do I deal with the revenue?</p>

<p>Of course, I could just do stuff "in-house", be it with their method to deploy Apps for testing purposes, or by using a jailbroken device. That might be preferable in my case, since I'm not doing this to make money with a "crazy idea" but simply for practice. Still, there are some fees ($100 a year?).</p>

<p>But there is the greater issue that developing for iOS feels like developing for the Java virtual machine, with none of the benefits of the virtual machine. I always liked the idea of developing as close to the OS' kernel as possible, and not be at the mercy of some restrictive APIs. Over the years, I became closer to a Linux developer than Windows, Mac, Android or iOS. In an ideal world, I guess I'd be an open-source developer.</p>

<p>Still, I think it's a good time to jump back in Mac and iOS development. The Mac Cocoa APIs surely matured in the past decade, without the cruft of the "Carbon" API from its Pascal days and the cross-compilation compatibilities with PowerPC. As for iOS, the new visual style of iOS 7 is perfect for a drawing-inept developer like me, as all I need is good and clean spacing of tasteful fonts in hand-picked colours, and not the high-resolution pixellated Photoshop mess of the past few years.</p>

<p>As for what software I'll write, I don't know. Very likely it will be a wholly unoriginal idea that I will do for myself first because the currently existing solutions either do it poorly or not to my taste. Then release them as free and add that to a proper "software portfolio". Compared to the crazy challenges I've had in the past few years, iOS development shouldn't be <em>that</em> difficultâ€¦</p>
