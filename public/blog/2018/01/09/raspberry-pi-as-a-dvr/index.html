        <div class="span8 offset2">
                <p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://benad.me/blog/2017/11/06/raspberry-pi-your-home-linux-server/">a previous post</a>, I started using my Raspberry Pi as my &ldquo;always on&rdquo; home server. This allowed my to place my other devices into either standby mode or shut down, and power them on using the Pi only when needed.</p>

<p>It just so happens that one of the devices was my <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> media server. As I already have an Antenna and a TV tuner (the <a href="https://www.silicondust.com/product/hdhomerun-extend/">HDHomeRun Extend</a>), in addition to the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/">Plex Pass</a>&rdquo;, I wanted to use my Plex server to record Over The Air (OTA) TV shows, when I ran into the problem that my server was in standby most of the time and would miss its recording schedule. Sure, this is a seemingly important missing feature of the <a href="https://www.plex.tv/features/live-tv-dvr/">Plex DVR</a>, but I guess I could write some scheduled script on the Pi to wake up the Plex server just before recording happens. Or what if I could just run a Plex server on the Pi just to record TV shows?</p>

<p>So I connected one of my spare portable USB drive to the Pi, installed a Pi version of Plex following the instructions on the <a href="https://dev2day.de/projects/">dev2day</a> site, and it worked! Sure, the primary limitation of the Pi compared to a PC, and why I won&rsquo;t move my main Plex server&rsquo;s content to the Pi, is its very limited CPU, to the point where all form of transcoding should be avoided. For OTA recordings, the format is typically MPEG-2 or MP4 for the video, and typically AC3 for the audio. On most devices there is a built-in AC3 decoder, including the Apple TV 4th Generation, the LG TV app and the iPad Air 2, so no transcoding was needed. On my iPhone SE the AC3 decoder didn&rsquo;t work (I even tested with the <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ios.html">VLC app</a>), and the transcoder on the Pi was just too slow for a smooth playback. And, of course, playing back the recording from the Pi itself on HDMI is far too slow.</p>

<p>If you combine an antenna, the HDHomeRun Extend, maybe some network switch (depending on setup and how many spare ports you have on your router), the Rasperry Pi, a low-power portable USB drive, the Plex Pass and finally an Apple TV, you have a complete and quite low-power OTA TV DVR solution and &ldquo;cutting the cord&rdquo; solution. Sure, it could be cheaper if you replace the Apple TV with something else (Does the Roku have AC3 decoding? Or maybe use your &ldquo;Smart TV&rdquo; Plex app), but for sure the overall experience is much better than whatever crap you get with your cable provider&rsquo;s DVR.</p>
