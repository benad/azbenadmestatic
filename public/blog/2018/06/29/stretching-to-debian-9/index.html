        <div class="span8 offset2">
                <p>The web page you’re currently reading is now hosted on a brand new Debian 9 server! The content is exactly the same as before, so you shouldn’t notice any difference.</p>

<p>So why did I update my server from Debian 7 to Debian 9? Well, <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2018/20180601.en.html">Debian 7 is now officially unsupported</a>, which means it won’t get any security update. The suport ended on June 1st, though I actually actuvated the new Debian 9 servers a few days after. The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">Long-Term Support for Debian 9</a> will last for a few years, so I won’t have to upgrade Debian anytime soon. This month I had a few other things to finish on the server to complete the move, but nothing that would be noticed from web browsers.</p>

<p>For technical reasons, I couldn’t do an in-place upgrade, and in my case it would have been both too risky and an excuse to <a href="https://benad.me/blog/2017/08/23/forever-64-bit/">move from 32-bit to 64-bit</a>. For the most part, the configuration of Debian 9 is similar in design to Debian 7, with just a few changes here and there. The initial move to the new server was done doing a simple DNS change to point to its new IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6), and I was able to fully test the new server, including its SSL certificate, by making local changes to my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file.</p>

<p>The most apparent difference came from doing a minimal install using the &ldquo;net installer&rdquo;. Debian 9’s minimal install is <em>very</em> minimal, and smaller than what is considered &ldquo;minimal&rdquo; in other Linux distributions like CentOS. For example, <code>ifconfig</code> was missing, as in theory the built-in <code>ip</code> and <code>route</code> commands ought to be enough, though quite impractical. I installed the <code>net-tools</code> package to fix that.</p>

<p>Another annoying change was the way Debian 9 handled IPv6 routing, and I ended up doing something like this in <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>:</p>

<pre><code>iface ens3 inet6 manual
    up ifconfig ens3 add 2604:180:3:e16::384c/64
    up route -A inet6 add default dev ens3
    up /sbin/ip -6 route add default via 2604:180:3::1 dev ens3
    up route -A inet6 del default dev ens3
    down ifconfig ens3 del 2604:180:3:e16::384c/64
    down /sbin/ip -6 route del default via 2604:180:3::1 dev ens3
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, it’s strange. For some reason, the ip route commands refused to add a static route until I set up a dummy, broken default route with the <code>route</code> command, which has to be removed for the static route to work. Maybe there was a better way to do it (and I tried disabing IPv6 auto-configuration, with no success), but since I was doing all of this from the VM’s console and I didn’t want to reboot the VM anymore, I won’t fix this for the time being.</p>
