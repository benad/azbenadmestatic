        <div class="span8 offset2">
                <p>This web site is running with Debian Linux 7, so <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2016/20160212.en.html">in May it won&rsquo;t be supported anymore</a>. I started making plans to move the server to Debian 8 or 9, when I noticed that all the Debian <a href="https://openvz.org/">OpenVZ</a> templates offered by my hosting provider are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing">64-bit</a>. At the time I chose a 32-bit Debian 7 VM since it has only 512 MB of RAM, but now I don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>

<p>Is this my last 32-bit computer? OK, maybe that depends on your definition of &ldquo;computer&rdquo;. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch">My watch</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_S1">32-bit</a>, and so I suspect whatever crap Sony used in my &ldquo;smart&rdquo; TV, let alone those cheap processors in my printer, router, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips_Hue">lightbulbs</a>â€¦ But my phone, tablet, game console, computers of all kinds, they&rsquo;re all 64-bit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced that a 64-bit processor in a system with less than 4 GB of RAM is that useful. I&rsquo;ve heard arguments that the additional virtual memory space can help security and that processing that requires lots of memory throughput is faster, but that still isn&rsquo;t that much compared to doubling the size of every memory pointer. In the case of this web site, the host computer is surely already 64-bit, so there could be significant performance degradation in running a 32-bit virtual machine in it.</p>

<p>Maybe the jump to 64-bit represents a final generational gap that is worth jumping over earlier than later. In my lifetime, I was born during 8-bit computing, and experienced the often difficult transitions between each doubling of memory space. They were so significant that early games consoles included their &ldquo;bitness&rdquo; in their names, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurboGrafx-16">TurboGrafx-16</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32X">Sega 32X</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64">Nintendo 64</a>.</p>

<p>And yet, with 64-bit, I don&rsquo;t expect such a gap to 128-bit in my lifetime, if ever. This isn&rsquo;t just a lack of vision, but rather plain math: 2^64 is about 18 billion GB, not of storage, but live RAM. At that point, moving directly to 128-but rather than some increment to something like 72-bit would just be wasteful.</p>

<p>What then should now be the measure of a &ldquo;gap&rdquo; in processing power? The number of cores? The transistor size? Even the clock rate was abandoned since it was an unreliable measurement of speed, and just being too technical for marketing.</p>
