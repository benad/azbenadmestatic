        <div class="span8 offset2">
                <p>It seems like we created a culture of extreme laziness concerning passwords. All major web sites track you so well and conveniently that beyond the initial sign-up, you never have to type a password. We also made it easy to ask for a password reset through some email confirmation of some kind, so even in the rare occasion we <em>ought</em> to remember our passwords, we don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The Apple ID, typically associated with an iTunes or iCloud account, is currently experiencing the effects of this culture of laziness, as Apple is <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/09/24/apple-flooded-with-icloud-password-reset-requests-amid-tightened-account-security-controls/">flooded by password reset requests</a> after people want to migrate their iPhone data (tied to their iCloud account and password) to the new iPhone 5.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s so sad about this situation is that, for those experiencing the issue, they couldn&#8217;t even bother re-using the same single password everywhere, including for their Apple ID, and remembering <em>only</em> that. I simply can&#8217;t believe humans can have such poor memory. Yet, usability-wise, there is a category of users that &#8220;brute-force&#8221; their way through functionality of software by treating its interface as challenges <em>against</em> its use rather than something to be learned. As we dumbed down interfaces to that particular group, their intellectual laziness was rewarded, including for simple memorization.</p>

<p>Eventually, we have to stand up against intellectually lazy users when it is clearly detrimental to them. Security is one of those moments when pure convenience <em>has</em> to be second. If a bank asks you for a secure password, you do <em>not</em> mess around with password resets. When, with an Apple ID, you can <a href="http://blog.benad.me/2012/8/5/your-password-sucks.html">remotely wipe out all of your Apple devices</a>, they had to take their stand and say that if you can&#8217;t remember your password <em>and</em> didn&#8217;t register a credit card to the account <em>and</em> can&#8217;t answer your own security questions, then you&#8217;re simply not serious enough about your security to warrant your account recovery. Bite the bullet, learn your lesson, and be smarter next time.</p>

<p>Am I the only one that think that we should bring a bit of <em>punishment</em> back into software design? Or should we endlessly praise the user&#8217;s ineptitude until their mistakes become too costly? Your hard drive crashed and you had no backup? <em>Tough</em>. No anti-virus and some weird software is creating havoc in your old, underpowered, cheap laptop? <em>Tough</em>. Can&#8217;t remember your password and recover your account? <em>Tough</em>. Some people need some bad experiences to learn from their mistakes, and it may be a good idea to punish some lazy users earlier than too late.</p>
