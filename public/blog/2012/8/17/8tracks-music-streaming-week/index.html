                <p>Going as far away as possible from random-based MP3 radio stations, there's <a href="http://8tracks.com/">8tracks</a>. It offers user-made playlists on songs. The songs come either from free tracks from <a href="http://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a>, or by uploading your own tracks. For some reason, uploading commercial tracks is accepted. When played the playlist won't shuffle, but at least it will loop.</p>

<p>There isn't a lot of curation from professional DJs, but then there are a lot of users uploading tracks that simply wouldn't be available elsewhere. And like an actual mixtape, having a fixed track ordering has its charms.</p>

<p>The iPhone app worked great, and its tagging system made it quite easy to find the combination of styles I wanted. Creating playlists can be done only through their web site, but as a music player the app was functional enough. I wish there were more 3rd party track sources, and the SoundCloud tracks are sometimes difficult to search for and could be better integrated.</p>

<p>Overall, I liked it. It doesn't beat Songza's incredible curation and shuffled playlists, but with its potentially infinite track collection I have to recommend it.</p>
