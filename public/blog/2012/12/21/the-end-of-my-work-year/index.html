                <p>Since I took the rest of the year as vacation day, today was my last work day of the year. What follows is two weeks of uninterrupted non-work, something I haven't done in a year. To put in context, I took no sick day off, and since January took 10 days of days off here and there.</p>

<p>Now, that sounds like a lot of days off, because it is, but this year my work was particularly stressful and intensive, with little to no breathing time. Actually, those two separate weeks of vacation were taken within days of becoming sick, so I wouldn't do much other than staying at home being sick or exhausted each time.</p>

<p>So, yeah, I won't be traveling in the next two weeks, and I'll fully disconnect from work-related worries. I've postponed so much stuff to do that many won't be done during those two weeks, but at least I won't start the coldest week of the year exhausted and swamped with things to do. At least I hope so.</p>
