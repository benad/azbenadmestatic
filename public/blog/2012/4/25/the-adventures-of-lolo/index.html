                <div class='posterous_autopost'><p>The trilogy of games titled &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Lolo">Adventure of Lolo</a>&rdquo; are very well made puzzle games made for the NES in the early 90s. I played them again recently, and they stood well the test of time. They are essentially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban">Sokoban</a>-like games, but with the addition of various creatures, and that you have to collect all heart items before getting the chest to open the door.</p>  <p>The first game (which wasn&rsquo;t released initially in Japan, oddly) has a good learning and difficulty curve. At the end though some levels are difficult because they are not too well designed. Passwords are provided for every &ldquo;floor&rdquo; (sets of 5 levels), though if you lose all 5 lives the &ldquo;continue&rdquo; will let you restart exactly at the level you lost.</p>  <p>The second game is quite more difficult, though it has better graphics, and passwords for every level. The end levels are also more interesting than in the first game.</p>  <p>The third game is more an adventure that will let you chose in what order you challenge each &ldquo;floor&rdquo;, so that if you get stuck you can get out of the floor and pick another one. The passwords are then much more complex given the various combinations of how you can beat the levels. The graphics are much nicer, and there are several boss battles.</p>  <p>So, if puzzles are your thing, those games are great. Considering how playable and well-made they were, I wonder why they don&rsquo;t re-release them on the iPhone and other platforms like that in a bundle.</p></div>
