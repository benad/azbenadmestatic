                <div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I mentioned in <a href="http://benad-blog.posterous.com/animated-arts">a previous post</a> that professional movie reviewers tend to review based on their expectations on what a movie <em>should</em> have rather than its artistic intent. With animated movies, I still contend that due to their different form, there should be more leeway about reviewing them, especially for the potential lack of plot (the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032455/">Fantasia</a> comes to mind).</p>  <p>I recently came across a re-edit for Star Wars made by &ldquo;the Movie Preview Critic&rdquo; called &ldquo;<a href="http://blip.tv/themoviepreviewcritic/star-wars-the-moviepocalypse-edit-6072806">Star Wars The Moviepocalypse Edit</a>&rdquo;. While it&rsquo;s considerably shorter than the original, you may want to watch the introduction and the conclusion (at the 1 hour 32 minutes mark). Essentially, it&rsquo;s Star Wars in the &ldquo;current&rdquo; style of movies, meaning with character development and motivation completely missing. One of the point of &ldquo;the critic&rdquo; is that good storytelling tends to follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetics_%28Aristotle%29#Content">Aristotle&rsquo;s Poetics</a>, in order of importance: plot, character, thought, diction, melody and spectacle. The thesis of &ldquo;the critic&rdquo; is that movies nowadays tend to use a reverse order of importance (spectacle first), killing the quality of story telling.</p>  <p>I tend to agree. Even in cases when the plot is thin because there is a greater emphasis on the other elements (the opera &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_flute">The Magic Flute</a>&rdquo; comes to mind), the plot and the characters are still critical to create an emotional bound with the audience. For example, with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483797/">Redline</a>, we still had to learn <em>why</em> the characters so much want to win. Even in Tron Legacy, with its thin plot, still exposes to a great length the characters and motivations (<em>thought</em>). Their plots are simple, but not all movies need a deep, complicated intellectual plot or one with endless twists and turns to be engaging, as long as characters and motivations are well established.</p>  <p>So, Roger Ebert wrote <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120321/REVIEWS/120329993/123">a scathing review</a> for &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1899353/">The Raid: Redemption</a>&rdquo;, and <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2012/03/hollywoods_highway_to_hell.html">had to defend it</a>. Somehow, I agree with him. Why? For three reasons.</p>  <p>First, movies can be forgiven for lapses in plot if they make it up in being art. Not just a spectacle, but something about human nature. Not all movies need to be life-altering, but often times in the stylistic approach and in the way the characters live in those fictitious worlds, it can tell <em>something</em> about what we are or what we should be. It could be as simple as the &ldquo;coolness&rdquo; of how JP in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483797/">Redline</a> doesn&rsquo;t take racing too seriously, the melancholic computer landscapes of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483797/">TRON: Legacy</a>&rdquo; or the unreal-ness of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296/">A Scanner Darkly</a>&rdquo;, they all have an artistic point to make, even if clumsily told. (Similarly, badly worded poetry can still be good, as so on.)</p>  <p>Second, you can make it up even with a lack of artistic depth with masterful originality. Not just being original, but being <em>good</em> at what was just invented. Being &ldquo;same but better&rdquo; is not sufficient to push the medium to new territories. Again, the many animated movies I hold dear all tend to have that &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve never seen something like that before, and we&rsquo;ll be bold at it&rdquo;.</p>  <p>Thirdly, it&rsquo;s about the message. To put it back into context, &ldquo;The Raid: Redemption&rdquo; is maybe the best martial arts movie out there. But it&rsquo;s not art and it&rsquo;s not much original. But to top it off, it&rsquo;s about <em>people killing other people</em> and almost nothing else. No wonder Ebert drew parallels between that movie and video games. Even in the highly-competitive Redline, racers don&rsquo;t actually <em>hate</em> each other. In &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063823/">Yellow Submarine</a>&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s about &ldquo;peace and love through music&rdquo;. I could keep on going. The whole movie of &ldquo;Raid&rdquo; is akin to &ldquo;violence porn&rdquo; (like &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467304/">Human Centipede</a>&rdquo; is about &ldquo;horror porn&rdquo;), where &ldquo;porn&rdquo; means devoid of anything of human sensibility. It could be the best movie of its genre, but if in the end it glorifies meaningless violence, why should I even care?</p>  <p>In the end, Ebert&rsquo;s criticism of someone&rsquo;s review (<em>err</em>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/oct/10/woman-sues-drive-trailer">lawsuit</a>) of Drive is the same as my criticism of Monji&rsquo;s review of Redline: you have the wrong expectations for a movie&rsquo;s genre, but it&rsquo;s still OK to have expectations about movies in general. Most <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2012/03/hollywoods_highway_to_hell.html#comments">comments on Ebert&rsquo;s post</a> are trash, so I skipped them. But on Monji&rsquo;s post, I loved that <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/demand/2012/03/elvis_fantasies_crotch_shots.html#comment-4456565">&ldquo;Rubi-kun&rdquo; drew parallels</a> between Redline and the original cut of &ldquo;The Thief and the Cobbler&rdquo;, another flawed animation masterpiece. And that is my point: Sometimes flawed movies can be the most beautiful and touching ones, and absolutely worth viewing.</p></div>
