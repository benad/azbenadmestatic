<p>Sorry for the terribly slow updates... I'm reworking on my <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/benad/">homepage</a>, and while it still doesn't look great, it has nice JavaScript animations, thanks to the <a href="http://moofx.mad4milk.net/">moo.fx</a> and <a href="http://bennolan.com/behaviour/">Behavior</a>, and it still looks great without JavaScript and/or CSS.</p>

<p>The excuse? I've been quite busy at work (who isn't?), and in the bast month I've had to fiddle with no less than 4 new operating systems (<a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhel/">RedHat EL 4</a>, <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora Core 5</a>, <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo 2006.0</a>, <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/index.jsp">Sun Solaris 10</a>), so I'll post the battle stories later.</p>

<p>Oh, and the "blogger" theme for LiveJournal messed up, so I'm reverting to another random one.</p>

<p>Sorry everyone, no April's Fools joke here... I'm keeping my energy for starting to do my taxes today.</p>
