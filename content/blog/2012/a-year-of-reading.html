<p>Well, I fell short of reading 10,000 pages worth of books this year. Even after a week of vacation, I barely read, catching up on so many movies and video games I haven't had to time to see while working full time. Still, maybe what I need to do is set aside some time to read, hopefully forming a habit.</p>

<p>Also, audio books help. At least I can catch up half an hour or more each time I used the public transportation to go to work. What doesn't help though is that audio books "compete" with the various podcasts I subscribe to, and quite frankly I listen to too many podcasts, even at 2x playback.</p>

<p>Same thing with magazines. I subscribe to a few, but that's enough to distract me from reading books. What helps though is that they are confined to my iPad, so on days when I don't want to use my iPad at all after work I have no choice but to read on my Kindle or Kobo, or pick an audio book if my eyes are <em>really</em> tired.</p>

<p>As for book selection, at the current pace, my "wish list" is large enough to fill 2013, so I'm not worried for that. It's not like there aren't enough good books out there anyway.</p>

<p>So, how short am I from my goal? Well, I read about 7500 pages, so 25% short. Not too bad, but if I didn't procrastinate for almost the entirety of December I would have surely read an extra 1000 pages or so.</p>
