<p>A few days ago I was trying to see if there was a decent book about Debian 6 on <a href="http://www.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari Books</a> through our corporate account at work, and found absolutely nothing. After seeing <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/story/12/05/10/1918233/english-translation-of-debian-administrators-handbook-available">this post on Slashdot</a>, I discovered the <a href="http://debian-handbook.info/">Debian Administrator's Handbook</a>. While I wouldn't have minded the French version (I speak French), the English one is free, and seems pretty complete. So I went ahead with a small donation and transfered the MOBI file to my Kindle.</p>

<p>I'll report back in a few week with a review of the book, of course. I already have some experience with Debian 5, so maybe I won't learn much, but considering I may have to set up a new Debian machine at work pretty soon I'll be able to make a review in the context of how useful it was.</p>
