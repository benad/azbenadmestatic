<p>I was <a href="http://blog.benad.me/2012/7/7/the-slow-ipad.html">complaining in July that my iPad was too slow</a>. Still, I wanted to wait a few months, just in case this mythical iPad upgrade could happen before the seemingly annual cycle falling in the first three months on the year. I was right. A performance-bumped and new-connector-based iPad replaced the &#8220;new iPad&#8221; today. And that&#8217;s what I got.</p>

<p>Oh, and the screen is amazingly beautiful compared to the original iPad. And the processor is roughly <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench2/compare/1234885/1213259">3.7 times faster</a>, <em>per core</em>, so effectively over 7 times faster. Also, 4 times the RAM, my primary issue with the original iPad. What I&#8217;m using right now just <em>flies</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, new users that start using iPad using this one wont be necessarily that impressed. We do notice large changes in speeds much better than gradual ones, especially for something you&#8217;ve use almost daily for two years. Still, I was expecting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore&#8217;s Law</a> kinds of speed increases, not something <em>twice</em> it. Never before a two-year difference was so drastic in a device family. Maybe. I suspect the upgrade from the almost 3-year old MacBook Pro to the latest models will be almost as drastic.</p>
