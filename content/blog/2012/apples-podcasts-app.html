<p>At last, Apple released an App for iOS for downloading and playing podcasts without the need to synchronize with iTunes. It's not too complicated to use, and has a new, beautiful "best stations" mode to browse for podcasts that complements the iTunes store section.</p>

<p>What's jarring is not more advanced features that's missing, like playlists or a "sticky" setting for playback speed, as all of these a better implemented in other non-free apps (iTunes's podcast playlist support never worked very well). It is the loss of support for "Enhanced Podcasts" with its chapter marks. You ca still <a href="http://library.rice.edu/services/dmc/guides/podcasting/enhanced-podcasting-in-garage-band">create them with GarageBand</a> and view them in iTunes, but this feature that was essentially invented for MP4 audio by Apple just disappeared.</p>

<p>I hope that this app becomes bundled with iOS 6 somehow, because I'd really like podcasting to have more visibility to new users. Also, it would be great if Android phones came with some basic podcasting app.</p>
