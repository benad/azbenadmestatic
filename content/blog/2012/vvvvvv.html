<p>There's a game I tend to go back to when I'm in a sour mood, and unexpectedly it's not a violent game. A game brutally difficult, but with such precise controls that all the losses are <em>only</em> your fault, not due by bad design or random chance.</p>

<p>The game is <a href="http://s.benad.me/O5CX44">VVVVVV</a>, a simple platform game made by <a href="http://s.benad.me/PBUGvI">Terry Cavanagh</a>. It's controls are even simpler than Mario: left, right, and V to flip the gravity. And from that simple twist, the game fully pushes it to its limits.</p>

<p>Visually, the game is slightly retro, yet has a lot of eye candy and polish. The music is downright amazing. The PC version of the game has a full level editor and a few extra levels. Back to the game, and maybe why I tend to prefer platformers and racing games, is the lack of randomness and rewarding both agility and precision. The result is like how <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/">Super Meat Boy</a> replays all your deaths when you finish a level, a kind of visual quantum evolutionary proof that the only thing that was random was the player.</p>

<p>Anyway. VVVVVV is a very good game. It's available on a ton of platforms, and it's pretty cheap.</p>
