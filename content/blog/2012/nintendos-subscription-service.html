<p>I think I just got a great idea. Now, for years Nintendo has been struggling with the competition from "casual games" from cellphones. They came up with things like "Brain Age", but they were 5 times too expensive, let alone the cost of buying something that doesn't do anything but play games. Yet, they're still sitting on this huge back catalog of game classics that are "milked out" at $5 dollars each.</p>

<p>OK then. How many would be willing to pay $5 per month to get unlimited access to all Nintendo-branded US games on the NES and SNES? Costs would be minimal, since the ROMs are so small, so that would be an almost pure profit of $60 per year. If you make that exclusive to a new game console (Wii U), and maybe even add it a few extras here and there so that you can call it "Nintendo+" or whatever, you'll get yourself a great promotional tool.</p>

<p>Oh, of course they won't do that. You'd need competent management to make such profitable and popular decisions...</p>
