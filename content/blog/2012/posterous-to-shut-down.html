<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I was about to finish the last two chapters and then review the book <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/25344/A-Clash-of-Kings" title="A Clash of Kimgs">A Clash of Kings</a> when I read the news that <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/big-news" title="Posterous Big News">Posterous was acquired by Twitter</a>. It&rsquo;s very clear that by the nature of their different businesses, this was a kind of talent acquisition, so when <a href="http://posterous.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/56001-acquisition-faq">on their FAQ</a> they weasel around the direct question &ldquo;Will you shut down?&rdquo;, it can&rsquo;t be clearer that they don&rsquo;t care and that it will shut down.</p>  <p>You get what you paid for, right? Man, I&rsquo;m getting tired of switching blog hosting. I still have my mirrors on both <a href="http://benad.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and <a href="http://benad.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a>, thanks to Posterous' auto-posting feature, but if the site closes within months the I have to find <em>something</em> more permanent. No, I&rsquo;m not going to host my own Wordpress site, because even if I could, maintaining security patches will stress me out.</p>  <p>I&rsquo;m seriously considering <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>. Their <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/features/">feature list</a> contains 90% of what I need, sound business, quality editing tools, reliable service, unlimited bandwidth, and so on. To transfer my posts, I&rsquo;ll have to use an intermediate, free Wordpress site <a href="http://www.squarespaceplugins.com/how-to-import-tumblr-to-squarespace-tutorial/">as mentioned in &ldquo;How to Import Tumblr to Squarespace</a> (notice in the screenshot Wordpress can import from Posterous). To be less caught at the last second, I&rsquo;ll do that import to Wordpress and then auto-post to it afterwards before the shutdown in announced. After that, I&rsquo;ll do a hard-switch to Squarespace and announce it everywhere.</p>  <p>What a pain. Way to flush a cool original idea (post by email everywhere) down the drain.</p></div>
