<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Well, this year&rsquo;s April Fool&rsquo;s day wasn&rsquo;t too bad. Engadget has a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/01/april-fools-day-roundup-the-big-toys-the-small-toys-and-the-c/">nice roundup of the jokes around the Internet</a>. Techcrunch has <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/3TsX9To8tbc/">a more complete list</a>. A special mention that&rsquo;s not listed in the above links goes to <a href="http://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a>, with a uniquely generated comic just for you, with <a href="http://redd.it/rnpiw">dozens of permutations</a> based on your browser type, ISP, location, window size and more.</p>  <p>I normally dislike browsing the web this day because too many time web sites would just post fake news that are plausible, meaning not funny and not obviously a joke, making the whole day a series of &ldquo;is that a real news&rdquo;? This year seems like the first time that the fake news are almost all obviously fake, and where the jokes are at least mildly amusing.</p></div>
