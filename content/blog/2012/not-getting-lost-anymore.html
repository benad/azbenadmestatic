<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Everybody that knows me well (and now you, unknown reader) knows how easily I can get lost, without or even with a map. Over the years I did practice reading maps, understanding them and so on, but in the end I just completely lack any sense of spatial direction.</p>  <p>For the past few years though things have been a bit different. Why? Because with my phone I now have a portable GPS and mapping system. Even better, with Google Maps I can use street view to see how the surroundings should look like. While that may not sound like a lot, this greatly helps. Before going some place, I &ldquo;virtually&rdquo; drive through the itinerary to familiarize myself with the path and how the destination looks like, so that if I&rsquo;m in a place that I haven&rsquo;t seen before I can actually trust my instinct that I&rsquo;m lost. In which case I take out from my pocket my iPhone and follow the way back on the map.</p>  <p>Now, I&rsquo;ve heard that Google and other companies started mapping out shopping centers and airports, though as usual they don&rsquo;t include much in Canada or Montr√©al. Hopefully it could come soon, so that <em>even indoors</em> I can&rsquo;t get lost. Well, most of the time.</p></div>
