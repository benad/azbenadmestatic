<p>Well, my 60 GB Windows 7 partition is not enough for what I&#8217;m doing. It should be fine for &#8220;light use&#8221;, but after installing the full Office 2010, Visual Studio 2010 Pro and countless other SDKs, it isn&#8217;t anymore. I&#8217;ve spent way too much time trying to clean up temporary files, removing the &#8220;hibernation&#8221; file and so on, and it&#8217;s just cutting too much on my productivity.</p>

<p>On desktops it is usual to combine a SSD boot drive and a big HDD for the rest, but on a small laptop you&#8217;re usually stuck choosing one or the other. True, some people mod their MacBook Pros to replace the optical drive with a HDD (or SSD), but I don&#8217;t want to do something as drastic (and void my warranty in the process).</p>

<p>Thankfully, there are self-powered external USB HDD, now at reasonable prices for 1 TB and higher. For example, the latest My Passport by Western Digital are now available up to 2 TB and support USB 3. They make your laptop less portable, but they&#8217;re still very convenient, not too expensive, and give a huge boost in storage space. They&#8217;re not new: The first iPods were based on portable HDDs in the first place before switching to smaller capacity solid-state memory. Still, SSDs haven&#8217;t increased enough in capacity to warrant a full replacement for many users, myself included.</p>
