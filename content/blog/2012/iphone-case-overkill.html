<p>As <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2012/1/17/iphone-4s-cases.html">I mentioned before</a>, I'm still planning of buying some case for my iPhone 4S. After a long day with the phone, using it like crazy for over 14 hours, including photos and videos and music playback for 2 hours and some gaming, it was down to 20%. Not too bad (especially compared to my old 3GS), but still worrying. That, and that fear I'll drop it.</p>

<p>So, I'm very tempted into buying the <a href="http://www.mophie.com/mophie-juice-pack-air-iPhone-4-4s-battery-case-p/1145_jpa-ip4-blk.htm">Mophie Juice Pack Air</a>, at least for a minimum of protection and a battery life boost of about 90%.</p>

<p>That, or if the extremely drop-paranoid in me wins, I'll just buy the ultra-protection and 150% battery boost of the military-grade <a href="http://www.mophie.com/juice-pack-PRO-Rugged-case-for-iPhone-4-4S-p/2120_jppr-ip4-blk.htm">Mophie Juice Pack Pro</a>. Overkill? Maybe, but on my next travel this would be very useful.</p>
