<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>At its core, Rango is a western movie. Yes it stars a pet chameleon that gets lost on a desert highway, and finds himself in a western town that is going through a drought. <em>(Yes, <a href="http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday/">World Water Day</a> was yesterday, but that was only a coincidence.)</em> Beyond that though, it is a superb animated movie by Industrial Light and Magic, worthy of its Oscar.</p>  <p>The movie is not simply a sequence of jokes loosely tied together with a story. While the odd storytelling style threw me away for the first fifteen minutes or so, I was hooked by the strong story for the rest of the movie. The voice acting, led by Johnny Depp, is excellent, again much more than stars attaching their names to a movie for the sake of the posters.</p>  <p>And I cannot praise enough the quality of the animation. It is not only well used to tell the story, but at times you are presented with <em>poetic</em> animation that will take your breath away. So, yes, you must see this in HD.</p>  <p>Overall, I highly recommend this movie, even if you don&rsquo;t particularly like westerns or animated movies.</p></div>
