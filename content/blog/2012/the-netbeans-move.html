<p>Today <a href="http://netbeans.org/community/news/show/1562.html">NetBeans 7.2 was released</a>. I had time only to install and test it a bit today, and as usual it's just that little bit faster than before.</p>

<p>I have the habit of keeping only the previous version (7.1) and removing the older version after an update (7.0). Since settings are imported from one version to another, I usually remove the older stuff from <code>~/.netbeans</code>, in this case <code>~/.netbeans/7.0</code>. And then I noticed that <code>7.2</code> was missing...</p>

<p>Right at the <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/NewAndNoteworthyNB72#Changed_location_of_userdir_and_cachedir">bottom of the lengthy "New and Noteworthy" page for 7.2</a> it refers to where the <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/UserdirAndCachedirFoldersInSystemSpecificPaths">userdir and cachedir directories moved</a>. At last NetBeans behaves like a native application for its settings and cache. That makes my backup filters in <a href="http://www.crashplan.com/">Crashplan</a> much easier...</p>
