<p>Recently, Amazon "invited" me to move my Kindle account from my Amazon.com account to the Amazon.ca account. That would help, I thought, since it is annoying to try to buy a Kindle book only to find out at the last second that it's "not available I my country".</p>

<p>Well, there were undocumented side effects. Yes, I had to recreate my wish list, which was expected though annoying, but that made it even more obvious which titles in my list were not available in Canada. For example, "<a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/13332761/The-Design-of-Design">The Design of Design"</a> and "<a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/27047544/Moment-Of-Clarity">Moment of Clarity</a>" both became unavailable were my account became Canadian.</p>

<p>The Kindle book selection in Canada still isn't as bad as comparing our version of Netflix to the US version, but still, it became apparent that its selection is far from the selection you can get in the US. What I found weird is that both of those books I mentioned were readily available on the Canadian Kobo store. I understand that Amazon may err on the side of caution were determining which books can be sold here, but then they will lose sales each time a competitor got the rights (or were not as cautious).</p>
