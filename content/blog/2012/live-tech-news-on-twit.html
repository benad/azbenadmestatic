<p>So, there was some kind of Microsoft announcement today. As with most Apple announcements, tech blogs tend to present some kind of live blogging of the event, containing also a few pictures here and there.</p>

<p>Personally, I prefer watching or listening to <a href="http://twit.tv/">TWiT</a> live. It's as if another news team would multi-task for me and aggregate all those live blogs and more for me. Also, they provide good live analysis. In this case, Tim Stevens, editor-in-chief of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> was also on the panel, bringing great analysis to Tom Merritt and Iyaz Akhtar.</p>

<p>As for the announcement itself? It was about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx">Surface</a>, Microsoft's own Windows 8 tablet. It looks cool, but they cop out without any announcement of dates or pricing, and their values estimates point towards end-of-2012. To early 2013 and more expensive than the iPad. So, meh.</p>
