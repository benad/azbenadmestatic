<p>There's a very good chance you have a camera on you right now. Yes, I'm talking about your cellphone's camera. While 10 years ago that would have been an horribly cheap camera, with a tortuous process to get the photos out of it to any computer or anybody else, now all the photos you take can be easily transfer through Wi-Fi, cellular data networks and on the Internets.</p>

<p>What's the big deal about it? Well just today there was <a href="http://journalmetro.com/actualites/montreal/69810/bombes-fumigenes-des-photos-de-suspects-devoilees/">an incident in the public metro of Montr√©al</a>, and it just so happens that there are photos of the suspects taken from another passenger's cellphone. It also works the other way around, to keep the police in check when they abuse of their powers during arrests.</p>

<p>But there's also the fact that taking photos is an excellent way of remembering things or places. That's why I really love how <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> integrates with cameras, which is really useful when comparing prices during shopping, taking "scans" of receipts, remembering the diagram you just drew on a whiteboard at work, and so on.</p>

<p>Oh, and on my iPhone it also takes 1080p videos. Not sure how I can effectively use that, though it's enough to make me feel overwhelmed by possibilities I can't think of right now.</p>
