<p>Since everybody ask me for advice for buying a TV, here are some of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Double-check the physical dimensions if it has to fit in or around existing furniture.</li>
<li>Technical specs, especially what connection ports a TV has, are nearly non existent on a web or physical store. The best trick is to note down the model number and download the user's manual directly from the manufacturer's web site.</li>
<li>Built-in video players, be it Internet playback or USB input, tend to be gimmicky and of low quality compared to stand-alone devices like <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a> and  <a href="http://wdc.com/en/products/homeentertainment/mediaplayers/">WD TV</a>.</li>
<li>Don't buy a TV unless you've seen it at least one in person or if you've been told from somebody you trust that it looks good. In the ends, specs are just specs, and your eyes should be the ultimate arbiter.</li>
<li>If you have a chance, try using the TV's remote and user interface. You don't want to be stuck for years with a difficult to use TV.</li>
<li>Of course, don't overspend on cables, especially digital ones. That's where the stores make their profit. Buy your cables in advance from speciality shops or on online, otherwise the rush to plug in your TV will make you overspend.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, that's it. Personally, I'd rather buy a home projector.</p>
