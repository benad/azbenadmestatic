<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>If the past two years are of any indication, my copy of <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/22815479/That-Is-All">That Is All</a> may be the last physical book I acquire. The same can be said for the one or two CDs and Blueray discs I got, since they are more &ldquo;collector&rsquo;s items&rdquo; than anything else.</p>  <p>It helps though. Those collector&rsquo;s editions are mostly just filled with useless crap. The ones I own are not due to their size or packaging, but for the extra contents I actually go though. Now though, few movies or music or even less books are worthy of their &ldquo;extra contents&rdquo;, be it remastered editions or new releases. So what that means is that physical copies of digital contents are now obsolete for me.</p>  <p>The obviousness of this is enormous, yet for all those years we were oblivious to it: If all media is data, and if the Internet can transfer data, then let the Internet transfer all media. Broadcasting and mass distribution of physical media requires a certain uniformity of demand to be economically viable, requiring a more uniform culture mediated by a handful (4 for music, actually) of distribution companies. So why should I care if they die a slow death in this brave new world? Because bribing US politicians is too easy?</p>  <p>So, begone, stacks of DVDs and CDs and video game disks and books. I grow jealous of the next generations, bringing to school a single Ebook reader (or two) for their books and an iPod for music and games, while for generations before kids would stuff in their backpack the equivalent of a third of their weight in massive books.</p></div>
