<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>At its basis, this iOS game is a RPG style done many times before of repeating battles from one &ldquo;generation&rdquo; to another until you can finally defeat the last boss rather than losing every time. You&rsquo;re a knight, and you use swipe gesture to attack in certain direction, or press &ldquo;hot spot&rdquo; areas at the right moment to attack weak spots or parry. Along the way you can collect cash and items, and each piece of equipment you carry can let you gain experience after battle until the equipment is mastered. That&rsquo;s essentially the gist of it. The game is relatively short before the &ldquo;generational loop&rdquo;, but there are a few different paths you can choose, and some optional battles to get some items.</p>  <p>Oh, and the graphics are amazing. The second game on an iPhone 4S supposedly looks even better, but for now the first game on a high-resolution screen looks amazing enough. Sol if you like RPGs and some action, this is a pretty good game.</p></div>
