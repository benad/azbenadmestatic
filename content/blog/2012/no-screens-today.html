<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I didn&rsquo;t sleep too well last night, and on top of that we lost an hour (DST), so today I&rsquo;m avoiding all screens, be it TV, computers or iPhone (VoiceOver mode). Actually, right now I&rsquo;m typing this on my Kindle, which <em>technically</em> doesn&rsquo;t count because it&rsquo;s not backlit.</p>  <p>OK, enough typing on this sucky keyboard.</p></div>
