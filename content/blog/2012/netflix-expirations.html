<p>Something that we, in Canada, we're starting to discover about <a href="http://netflix.ca/">Netflix</a> is that some movies in their catalog expire. Also, <em>when</em> they expire appears only within weeks of the actual expiration. So, movies in your "Watch List" might start disappearing over time.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there's the site <a href="http://can.whatsnewonnetflix.com/">What's New On Netflix Canada</a>, which not only lists new releases daily, but also movies that are about to expire. I'd recommend this site for all Canadian Netflix users, unless you want to be stuck with the site's recommendation engine.</p>

<p>Sadly, there are a big bunch of movies expiring on June 1st, as <a href="https://twitter.com/newonnetflix/statuses/206451477626109953">tweeted by the "New On Netflix" owner</a>, with some from my current "Watch Later" list. That means I'll have to binge on Netflix for the next few days...</p>
