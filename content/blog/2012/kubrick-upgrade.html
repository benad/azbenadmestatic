<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>As I&rsquo;m reviewing the movies made by Stanley Kubrick, I&rsquo;m starting to get to the point where their visual aspect is important, actually spectacular. It just so happens that there is a <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Stanley-Kubrick-Collection-Spartacus-Strangelove/dp/B004VDL7ZE/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I3LER29UJYX4I8&amp;colid=1OKOL6JMGJCBP">collection of Kubrick movies on Blu-ray</a>. To compare, I bought this <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Stanley-Kubrick-Collection-Widescreen-Discs/dp/B00005ASUK/ref=sr_1_12?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334881990&amp;sr=1-12">9-disk DVD collection</a> in 2003.</p>  <p>Now, I&rsquo;m normally against buying newer media, and I postponed buying a Blu-ray player for the longest time out of spite against Sony, but this time I might make an exception. My rationalization is that those Blu-rays have far more extra features than my old DVD set. In my DVD set there were no extras or commentaries whatsoever, but seemed to make it up with a feature-length documentary (that&rsquo;s not available on the Blu-ray set). And the thing is that I <em>will</em> watch all the extras, so that may be well worth the price. So, there, they&rsquo;ll get my money.</p></div>
