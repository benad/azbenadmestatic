<p>I read <a href="http://www.emptyage.com/post/28679875595/yes-i-was-hacked-hard">this blog post about a hacked iCloud account</a> with some amusement. Not that I'm immune, so I too have an iCloud account. No, it's just that if you're willing to tie so much personal information and <em>entire devices</em> to a single account, your password must be <em>really</em> secure.</p>

<p>But then, if if your password was a monstrous string of random symbols, you still run the risk of somebody stealing your account through other means. Maybe you used an insecure computer that stole your keyboard presses. Or maybe the answers to the password recovery questions were too easy to guess. The trick, then, is to try your best to isolate accounts from each other.</p>

<p>Now I feel the sudden urge to change my passwords and review my security questions. I already use two-factor authentication with Google and LastPass, but hardening iCloud can't hurt...</p>
