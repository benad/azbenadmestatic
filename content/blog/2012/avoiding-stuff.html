<p>On the eve of Quebec's "national moving day", we are reminded about how much <em>stuff</em> we have. Furniture we don't use anymore, decorations and things that only "embellish" and that we can do without, clothes we don't want to wear anymore, un-recyclable objects we keep in the hopes a recycling solution may one day exist (other than dumping that in China), and so on.</p>

<p>Worse, consumerism is expected, especially if you have disposable income (if not, credit cards are your friends). Luckily for me, I despise shopping and buying stuff. Media in pure digital form I don't mind too much, but even without physical space I still feel like I'm spending too much on movies, music and books. Am I a freak in this "money is fun" world?</p>

<p>I say: Live lean. When I travel, I have 3 days worth of clothing and basic necessities in a bag small enough for a carry on luggage a plane. <em>(I consider my iPad and iPhone "essential", and it still fits in the bag.)</em> If what's essential in your life doesn't fit in that bag, then you need to carefully thing about what "stuff" is really essential, and cut down on everything else. Or at least make a big garage sale.</p>
