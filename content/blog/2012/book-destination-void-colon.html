<p>I approached the book "<a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/46104/Destination-Void">Destination: Void</a>" by Frank Hebert only because its sequel (<em><a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/46103/The-Jesus-Incident">The Jesus Incident</a></em>) was highly praised, and because of its vague connection to the plot of the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_Trilogy">Marathon</a>. To be blunt, it wasn't a good book. Not terrible, but not good either.</p>

<p>Its synopsis is intellectually interesting: With what kind of environment and tools can you develop a (hard) artificial intelligence? So you have clones sent in a colony ship to a planet 400 light-years from here, and it is controlled by a human "brain in a jar". The brain failed (went insane), and so were the two other backups. As a result, four colonists are awaken from hibernation to manually control the ship's near-infinite controls, which leads to the realization than an AI is required.</p>

<p>And the the book spends way too much time about how this AI is built, with maddening sci-fi pseudo-science. The dangers of manually controlling the ship aren't well described, the tension between the characters turn into clich√©s, there are conspiracies on top of conspiracies, and the end is jarring, begging for a sequel that will be written 13 years later.</p>

<p>I'm not too bitter, and I shouldn't be too much of an "armchair critic" for an award-winning book of such an esteemed author. But I sense that I prefer good storytelling over plot and cleverness. As an example, I still prefer the beautiful meanderings of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield">David Copperfield</a></em> (by Charles Dickens) than the episodic twisting plots of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>. As odd as it sounds, the former is more difficult to write than the latter, as it relies more on talent than planning or inspiration.</p>

<p>All that to say, I need to read a whole lot more. For now though, I'll have to go back to a bunch of non-fictional books.</p>
