<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>A quick post today to mention an hypothesis about why people tend to use Netflix for TV shows rather than just movies. Well, apart from the obvious reason that if you use your Internet access to replace cable or satellite, then maybe you&rsquo;d like to use Netflix to watch TV like you would normally do, meaning mostly for TV shows.</p>  <p>When the days are short and you have little spare time, blocking roughly two hours straight is just too difficult to watch a movie. Also, breaking up a movie into multiple parts (unless the movie really has parts) doesn&rsquo;t work well for the pacing and the buildup of tension. It just so happens that 30-minute blocks are the most convenient. For me, even 1-hour shows tend to be too long to fit well in my schedule.</p>  <p>So, maybe this weekend I&rsquo;ll have time to watch a movie or two, but for me it&rsquo;s been frustrating that during weekdays, after a long day of work, I simply don&rsquo;t have the time or energy to watch a full movie.</p></div>
