<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>In the past few weeks, it seems like posting a new message to Posterous Spaces works sporadically. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get in touch with tech support, and all I got was a confirmation that on certain days it can take <em>hours</em> for an email port to show up in Posterous.</p>  <p>I suspect some people are abusing of the video posting capabilities of the email interface, all the while with under-provisioned servers to handle the email queue. Yes, it&rsquo;s a FIFO queue, that does not prioritize in any way short plain-text emails like mine.</p>  <p>Another facet that annoys me is that the web interface for posting using anything but a full-fledged web browser, meaning an iPad or Opera Mini, seems to ignore line breaks in my messages unless I wrap everything within Markdown tags. Effectively, if they drop the Markdown support, I will have absolutely no reliable way of posting style-rich messages to Posterous from my iPhone or iPad. (BTW, their app doesn&rsquo;t automatically save drafts, and does only plain text, so I&rsquo;m avoiding it.)</p>  <p>Hey. Posterous staff, if you&rsquo;re reading this, what used to be your killer feature (email posting) is rapidly going downhill while you can barely compete with Google+ since your redesign. Oh, and without any proper, non-crippled backup mechanism (#1 requested feature), you&rsquo;re making me regret my decision of sticking with Posterous after all those years.</p></div>
