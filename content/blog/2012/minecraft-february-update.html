<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Today in Minecraft I went in an expedition in the Nether to find some Nether Warts, which is a key ingredient for brewing potions, especially health potions. Once you find some warts you can farm them inside the Nether, but they can be found only within some Nether fortresses. Is it considered cheating if I used the &ldquo;Minecraft X-ray&rdquo; tool to find them rather than wandering around for hours? Even when using X-ray getting there is still quite a challenge, building bridges across lava while avoiding Ghasts.</p>  <p>I also would like to note that my brother built a &ldquo;creeper-proof&rdquo; safe room, using bricks and an iron door that requires the use of a switch, to store all of our highly valuable items. We&rsquo;ve both heard of rumors that the next release of the game will have better AI, so he&rsquo;s not taking any chances.</p>  <p>At this point, with the warts that my brother is now farming, we are preparing ourselves for a final push to &ldquo;The End&rdquo;. We still have a few more items to collect, including a few Eyes of Ender, but after that it may be time to battle the dragon once and for all&hellip;</p></div>
