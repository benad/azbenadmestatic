<p>Today, I had to print some receipts from web transactions done from a Windows 7 machine, and I didn't have a printer available. So, I used the built-in XPS printer, which prints to an XPS file. Well, I would have preferred to have a PDF converter, but I didn't want to install any more software on my disk-restricted Windows 7 partition. <em>(Yes, because I work at <a href="http://www.nuance.com/">Nuance</a>, I can use <a href="http://www.nuance.com/products/pdf-converter-professional/index.htm">PDF Converter Pro</a> for free, but I really was running out of disk space.)</em></p>

<p>So, back to my Mac, I now have my XPS file. How do I convert that yet-another Microsoft proprietary file into PDF? Well, I found a way to do it from <a href="http://blog.rubypdf.com/2009/04/14/convert-xps-to-pdf-in-two-ways/">an obscure blog</a> using a sub-project of the open-source <a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/">Ghostscript</a> called GhostPDL. Sadly, the <a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/download/gxpsdnld.htm">binaries provided</a> are only for Linux and Windows. No panic!</p>

<p>Remember my post <a href="http://blog.benad.me/2012/8/25/fz7o78x6nozj4vpaar6u3udy8sby1p">from Saturday</a>? Install Wineskin, create an empty wrapper, move both <code>gxps</code> and our XPS files in the wrapper's "C drive", use the advanced setting to start a DOS console, and run the command <code>gxps</code> on your file. That may not be very user-friendly, but it's all free (as in speech, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>), and works on a Mac.</p>
