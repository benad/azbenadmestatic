<p>Being stuck for weeks on end writing software for Windows, including Windows 8, it feels like I'm getting fed up of using <em>computers</em>. I wouldn't touch my MacBook Pro, and end up on my iPad, avoiding any form of "general-purpose computing" that could be confused with work.</p>

<p>If I'm lucky, at times I have to interact with my Linux machines, and there's a sense of relief. Even <a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> feels reasonable compared with the pseudo-DOS command-line prompt of Windows. Yes, the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">GNU Coreutils</a> are <em>far</em> better than whatever kludge you can do on DOS.</p>

<p>And now, for a few minutes, I'm back to Mac OS X. Oh, what a relief. Fonts that don't suck. A perfectly working trackpad and scrolling mechanism, <em>even when inverted</em>. A multi-lingual system <em>for free</em>. Here, right now, I'm typing this on the beautiful editor <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a>, with a slight colour gradient on the top and bottom, and that subtle off-white colouring and font <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ux3vncNNLg">that would make Bateman jealous</a>. Oh, and it supports transparent auto-saving to <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a> or the local drive, like most 10.8 applications, so no more command-S reflex. Heck, if I wanted to, I could just go back to <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> on the built-in UNIX terminal, with its elegant alpha-channel transparency and shadow. To think that two days ago a coworker was complaining that in Windows 8 desktop there's no drop shadow anymore, making it even more difficult to tell which window was activeâ€¦</p>

<p>True, there are many feats of engineering in Windows 8, but all of that is moot given its jarring virtualization layer, the half-forgotten desktop mode, and just the lack of design quality that only people "in the know" (or those who care) annoyingly notice. It's like comparing Windows Server and a well-maintained <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> box. You can almost tell where the money was wasted and what was designed by a committee of shills.</p>
