<p>In an attempt to create revenue, Twitter is starting to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/twitter-officially-launches-v1-1-of-its-api-developers-have-until-march-5-2013-to-switch/">crack down on 3rd-party clients</a>. At the same time, Twitter's own "official" clients are getting worse over time, especially if you're using Twitter more than just a casual user.</p>

<p>One feature available on <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> should be standard within Twitter, something that we are used to with email: Keeping track of "unread tweets", or at least remember where you left it off. There is a 3rd-party service called <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker</a> that is supported on a bunch of clients. There is also a Chrome extension to Tweet Marker called <a href="http://www.spiderpig.de/webmarker/">WebMarker</a> that works well with the Twitter web site. I found the combination of Tweetbot and WebMarker to be indispensible.</p>

<p>That, or I could learn to just "let go" of tweets that are too old. The reason I still use a lot RSS through <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> is because it remembers which articles you've read or not, and since Twitter still has (for the time being) an RSS feed for each user, it's quite easy to subscibe to some user's feed and make sure I never miss a thing.</p>
