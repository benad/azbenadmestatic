<p>Roaming data plans are just horrible. Also, paid WiFi access spots are overly expensive, and a pain to set up on an iPhone. This is why the apps "Kayak" and "Gate Guru" seem so much like a huge wasted opportunity.</p>

<p>My greatest annoyance with airports, especially during transfers, is how easy it is to potentially get lost, or sometimes going in the wrong direction when you have only a few minutes to catch the next plane. So of course I would love to be able to use the Gate Guru app to have a quick access to airport maps from all around the world. Combined with Kayak, with its integration with many travel services and information, and those would be amazing to use. <em>If</em> you have data access.</p>

<p>In the end, I end up preferring travel guides packaged as ebooks, essentially electronic forms of those convenient paperback guides. In that case, using e-book readers like the Kindle, with their long multi-days battery life, are useful when you won't be able to recharge your devices at all for days. I consider offline access essential when traveling, and as such the iPhone isn't of much use, while an iPad or Kindle pre-loaded with lots of offline travel e-books and PDF maps work great.</p>
