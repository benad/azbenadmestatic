<p>A few years ago, I had to set up a new Linux server, so I installed <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/en/">Fedora Limix</a>, thinking it would be a nice alternative to RedHat and CentOS. And I made a big mistake.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is that releases are done at a breakneck pace, often breaking backwards compatibility. For a desktop machine, it's not too much of a problem. But for a server, doing a full system upgrade every few months is not a good option.</p>

<p>And now I'm stuck with an old Fedora 11 server. Can I upgrade to Fedora 18? Maybe, if I good through 12, 13, 14 and so on up to 18, and hope that massive sequence of upgrades doesn't break absolutely everything. My only other option then, considering the large amount of customization I did in it, is to clone it in a virtual machine in a <a href="http://blog.benad.me/2012/7/14/headless-virtualbox.html">headless VirtualBox</a>, and hope for the best.</p>
