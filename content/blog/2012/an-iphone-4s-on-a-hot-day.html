<p>So, today was the first summer day since I bought my iPhone 4S, and I can feel it. Playing Infinity Blade II while charging the phone, made the metal bands around the phone quite warm. Not too uncomfortable, but enough to make me worry a bit.</p>

<p>This is similar to my Core 2 MacBook Pro that would tend to kick on its fans at full speed far too easily. When that happens, the metal surface just below the screen would get almost warm enough for cooking (80 C).</p>

<p>No matter how much I used laptops and cellphones, I still have the mindset of using a somewhat silent desktop that keeps me unaware of the CPUs temperature. Even in cases when I've first-hand experienced a warm, sauna-like room full of rack-mounted servers, I still can't accept that computers are leaking heat. Are we pushing the edge of chip complexity too much? Do we really need 4+ cores in a cellphone? Could we go back to where cellphone can last more than a day without a recharge?</p>
