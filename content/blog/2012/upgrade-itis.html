<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Even though the next version of Mac OS X, err&hellip;. I meant OS X seems interesting and relatively cheap, I&rsquo;m not quite ready yet for Apple&rsquo;s fast-paced release schedule of one new version per year. Going to 10.7 last time still took me a good 3 months. That was still not as bad as 10.5, which broke backwards compatibility so much I had to upgrade $200 worth of software.</p>  <p>This is in stark contrast to iOS app upgrades, which I blindly do several times a week. But then, those updates are free, the apps are relatively cheaper, and my work doesn&rsquo;t depend on them.</p>  <p>(Short post today. Work is getting difficult this week.)</p></div>
