<p>Well, it seems like <a href="http://blogs.skype.com/en/2012/11/skypewlm.html">MSN Messenger will finally close down</a> early 2013. Not that it's completely gone, but simply absorbed into the messaging infrastructure of Skype.</p>

<p>Ten years ago we were using ICQ, AIM, MSN, and later even Google Talk, so to survive we had to use a multi-protocol client like <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a> or <a href="http://www.trillian.im/">Trillian</a>. It was messy. Since that my workplace moved to some form of corporate instant messaging, my buddy lists cleanup up of those various work accounts, just to realize that, well, outside of work nobody is using instant messaging clients anymore. Well, at least outside of cheap replacements for SMS on cellphones.</p>

<p>So, what do people use for chatting nowadays? Or do they really chat using instant messaging? I've heard that the IM integrated in Facebook was somewhat popular, but compared to the massive popularity of chat rooms and IM ten years ago it seems we have shifted somewhat towards more egocentric forms of communication. It's as if we all moved to sending emails by mailing lists to our "friends" with a very limited feedback form. It's as if we're not discussing anymore, but rather competing on how can get more attention by yelling louder in a crowded room.</p>
