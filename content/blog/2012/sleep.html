<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>How much do you sleep each day? That question may seem unusual, but I&rsquo;m getting the impression that no matter how tired I feel right now, sleeping 10 hours per day is often not enough for me.</p>  <p>That may seem odd coming from somebody that could have a reputation of a computer hacker, but even if I&rsquo;m not a morning person, my limited definition of &ldquo;coding at night&rdquo; ends at 10 PM. I know that I can lose sleep when my stomach doesn&rsquo;t feel too well, but still, living a life where each day is only 14 hours, and 12 hours in the weekends, makes me jealous of people that can get away with 6 hours of sleep without problem.</p>  <p>Should I just start drinking coffee and wake up at 6? Should I start watching TV until 11 or midnight? Should I do even less exercise (is that even possible)? Should I get a baby kid (if so, uh, how)?</p></div>
