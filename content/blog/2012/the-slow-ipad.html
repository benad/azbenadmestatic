<p>Is it just me, or the <a href="http://www.kobobooks.com/iphone">Kobo app for iPad</a> on the original iPad is kind of slow and buggy? It works, but barely...</p>

<p>Same for Netflix app. And the app store app. And about half of the apps. Actually, the lack of RAM on the iPad makes it stuck with the same situation as the iPhone 3GS on iOS 5, but slightly worse. In a way, given the future plans Apple had for the platform, the iPad and iPhone 3GS had just barely enough RAM <em>at the time of the original release</em>, so over time things got worse fast.</p>

<p>After 2 years, I think I might update to whatever new thing Apple has for the iPad. On the 3GS the 2.5 years were not as painful though, so I guess 2-3 years is the typical expected upgrade cycle for iOS devices. I'd prefer a more acceptable 3 years, but considering that even on my iPhone 4S the warranty is two years I guess the message is clear.</p>

<p>Oh well. It's not like I wasted my money with the iPad, given the countless hours I used it.</p>
