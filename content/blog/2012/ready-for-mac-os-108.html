<p>With the first update to Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion" <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/08/23/apple-releases-os-x-10-8-1-with-fixes-for-migration-assistant-exchange-and-imessage-issues/">released this week</a> (10.8.1), am I ready to update my work laptop? After using it on my old laptop for a little while, I think so, but only after a thorough backup, just in case.</p>

<p>The same can be said for <a href="http://www.vmware.com/support/fusion5/doc/fusion-50-release-notes.html">VMware Fusion 5</a>. It seems like an incremental upgrade, but doing so from version 4 would give me the "Pro" version with an advanced virtual network editor and a license VMware Player.</p>

<p>Combining both upgrades could be risky, so if anything doesn't work I'll revert to a backup. Otherwise, it will be a small but nice incremental upgrade for this fall.</p>
