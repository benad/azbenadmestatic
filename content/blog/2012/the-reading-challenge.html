<div class='posterous_autopost'><div>Last year I made a non-New-Year resolution to read more, and I've set myself the goal to read at least 10,000 pages from actual books. Well, "reading" was including audiobooks, so that whatever book I listen to during my daily transit would count.</div><p /><div>Looking at the list of 30 books I've read and tracked on Shelfari (&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shelfari.com/benad/goals">http://www.shelfari.com/benad/goals</a> ) I can see that a large portion of those books were ones that I wanted to read for a long time but procrastinated to do so. I would use "storage of the physical books" as an excuse, and now having an iPad, Kindle and Kobo (overkill, so don't ask why), that excuse went away and I could read. But now that I've been through the "must-reads", what should I read?</div><p /><div>Yeah, there are tons of classics out there, but my issue with them is that while they stood the test if time, they did not did so necessarily because they're <i>that</i> good, but maybe because they were culturally significant. At the same time, the book industry churns out a <i>lot</i> of crap that get popular for some reason or another.</div><p /><div>So I need good book recommendations from people that have good taste (I don't mind that much if they don't have the exact same taste as mine, but at least can tell the difference between crap and not crap), without being overly influenced by the "industry". This seems just as difficult as getting good music recommendations these days.</div></div>
