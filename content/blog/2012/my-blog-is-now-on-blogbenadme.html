<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Well, I just finished moving my blog to <a href="http://blog.benad.me/">blog.benad.me</a>. Kind of. It&rsquo;s still hosted by <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a>, and <a href="http://benad.me/">my web site</a> is still hosted by <a href="http://fused.com/">Fused</a>. It seems that recently their configuration panel now supported an &ldquo;Advanced DNS Zone Editor&rdquo;, which let me point &ldquo;<code>blog.</code>&rdquo; to either an IP (&ldquo;<code>A</code>&rdquo; record) or another domain (&ldquo;<code>CNAME</code>&rdquo; record). Since Posterous supports custom domains, this was a breeze to set up.</p>  <p>Now, I&rsquo;m already halfway ready to move my blog to <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>. Painfully (totally caused by Posterous), I finally was able to copy all my posts from <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> to <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>. I had to manually re-insert tags, remove duplicates, re-autopost missing posts, and so on.</p>  <p>Below is a summary of the current post migration, and the way <a href="http://blog.benad.me/">blog.benad.me</a> will eventually point to what&rsquo;s on Squarespace. <em>You can see the image also <a href="http://d.pr/Zyy6">here</a>.</em></p></div>
