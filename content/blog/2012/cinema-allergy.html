<p>I went to a cinema today, and went through some horrible experience, though I highly suspect that it's just me. First, I was wearing long sleeves, and still and air conditioning was so cold (I estimate 15 C) that I was shivering throughout. But then, maybe I'm too thin. This resulted with me wanting to pee quite badly 10 minutes in a 160-minutes movie. After 30 minutes I couldn't bear it anymore. Second, the loud vibrations of the subwoofer made my stomach feel not so good, which exacerbated the aforementioned shivering and peeing issue.</p>

<p>And so this is why I dream of getting myself a good quality projector. All things considered they're not too expensive, and since I don't casually watch TV I'd save money on a TV set.</p>

<p>Well, all that shivering and upset stomach made me slightly ill this evening. I'll think I'll stop toying with my custom-made Perl implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4">RC4</a>... <em>(Hint: Perl sucks at binary mixed with arithmetic operations.)</em></p>
