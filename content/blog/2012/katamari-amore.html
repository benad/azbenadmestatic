<p>Katamari Amore is the latest iPhone game of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> series. If you've never played any game in that series, here's a summary of the gamplay: You're a little alien pushing a sticky ball that collects objects if they're small enough. This grows the ball, allowing you to roll in it bigger and bigger objects, until you can collect entire buildings.</p>

<p>The Katamari series used to be almost exclusive to Sony game consoles, so I totally missed out on the series until their latest iPhone game. While it's free to download, it acts as a very short demo until you buy level packs. The demo is quite short relative to the cost of the packs (3 packs, $7 each), so that's why at first I was reluctant to shell out so much for an iPhone game. Don't be worried, each level pack is quite big, with 7 levels each, 4 game modes for each, lots of unlockeables and so on.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the 3rd level pack, so I now bought the 1st one. A level pack easily keeps me busy for roughly 6-8 hours, so the price is still on the expensive side, but acceptable.</p>

<p>My main gripe is about the controls, which tends to be often too difficult to maneuver around corners or just turn around, but I'm not sure if the game was designed that way or if it was just a difficult transition to the iPhone. Otherwise I really enjoy this game, still surprised by the huge variety of objects I can collect and just the <em>epicness</em> of it all.</p>
