<p>I had a lot of IT issues today, centered around having to install both Visual Studio 2010 and 2012 at the same time. Normally, this isn't much of an issue, but on a small 60GB partition this proves to be difficult. Having an external USB drive I thought that I could simply install both of them there, and again I was wrong: Part of Visual Studio <em>has</em> to be on the C drive.</p>

<p>Why NTFS, or actually Windows, doesn't support some kind of symbolic link that allows transparently mapping a path to another drive baffles me. Actually, their file system makes Apple's clunky and hopelessly hacked HFS+ (plus journaling) seem modern in comparison. If the C drive became the default file system root, at the very least give a simple option to "graft" additional drives to it...</p>

<p>Now, that just reminds me how much I need to upgrade my laptop to something with a 512 GB SSD. But then, I was planning to do so in Summer 2013, having bought an external 1.5 TB portable USB drive to compensate. Oh well, maybe one day I'll have a chance to work at a place where either IT provides me with decent computer hardware, or not having to use Windows all the time...</p>
