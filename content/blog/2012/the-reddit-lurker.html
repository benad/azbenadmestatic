<p>OK, I admit, I'm a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> lurker. I don't post or reply much, because by the time I read a thread a hundred posts were already made that are more clever or insightful than anything that I could post. So I just lurk.</p>

<p>I used to be on the now nearly-dead <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> before the now infamous "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg#Digg_v4">Digg v4</a>". And before that, I think I hung out (lurked) for a little while on <a href="http://forums.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade's forums</a> <em>way</em> back then before the multiple redesigns/resets, specifically the "<a href="http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/social-entropy-">Social Entropy</a>" forum.</p>

<p>It's always entertaining to read the drama, the fights, the laughs or just the sheer insanity. Sometimes (but some often) I learn something in the process, though generally I assume that everybody there is not at all trustworthy without valid references to other sites. At times the idiocy and horror is so overwhelming that I shield myself by assuming they're just trolling, though I should be more willing to accept that people out there can often be <em>horrible</em>.</p>

<p>So, post away, masses of redditors. Let go of that torrent of posts and inane replies for all those creeps lurking around Reddit in secret...</p>
