<p>A quick post today, since I worked <em>way</em> to late yesterday.</p>

<p>I those days where we're ramping up our electrical bills with all that air conditioning, I did a quick check about the maximum power consumption of my computers. Of course my laptop, a mid-2010 17" MacBook Pro consumes far less energy than a full-sized tower, at maximum 85W compared to nearly 600W for a typical gaming tower (my brother's).</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the Mac Mini also has a maximum 85W usage. Its components are similar to a MacBook, so that would explain it, but still as a server it would consume roughly 5 times less than a tower. At it makes so little noise that you can leave it running all day in a open room rather than a closet. True, a decent tower would run faster, but as a media and VM server for a few small VMs it's quite decent.</p>

<p>So, yes, it's a good idea to factor in the electricity usage of your devices.</p>
