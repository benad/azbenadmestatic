<p>A short post today. I always wondered why so many VoIP codecs were closed source, especially since devices on both ends of the channel would end up having to pay royalties. Also, while Ogg audio is pretty good for music, it isn't very good for low-bandwidth speech compression needed for VoIP.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find the <a href="http://opus-codec.org/">Opus audio codec</a>, a BSD-style licensed versatile codec. This <a href="http://opus-codec.org/comparison/">bitrate comparison</a> speaks for itself. Seems like it would be a great replacement for "good old" Speex.</p>
