<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Three things jumped at me when I watched the movie Drive, by little-known Danish director Refn. First, Ryan Gosling&rsquo;s performance is amazing. Second, the 80&rsquo;s-style new-retro soundtrack is also amazing. Third, each shot is beautifully framed, and amazing too.</p>  <p>I was putting off watching that movie for the longest time, ignoring the critics' praises, since for some reason I kind of dislike Gosling. Also, I knew that the trailers were not representative of the movie and that it wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;Fast and Furious&rdquo; kind of action movie, but then that made me even more cautious since I didn&rsquo;t knew what to expect either.</p>  <p>In the end, it is an action-thriller with a few car chases here and there but with a lot of other action scenes too. As a warning, some of the action is quite brutal, and even if I was warned about it I was still shocked. Yet, it is rare to see such a kind of action movie with such a great direction and acting. The acting direction is excellent, making each actor greatly contrast each other. At the central point, Gosling&rsquo;s character is mostly stoic, yet he does so not out of bad acting but by acting out of amazing subtlety. As I mentioned earlier, each shot is amazingly beautiful, in the palette of colors, the framing, and the near-perfect camera control. Oh, and the eclectic 80s soundtrack fits perfectly and will move you.</p>  <p>So, go watch it. That movie actually deserves more hype.</p></div>
