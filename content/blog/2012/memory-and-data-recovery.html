<p>Sitting in a shelf there's the internal hard drive of my parents' PowerMac 6100, a Quantum ProDrive LT SCSI with a "1994 Apple firmware" (whatever that means). If I can find a way to connect it to a modern computer through any means, I could restore old memories of the first computer I used for software development (C and C++ on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWarrior">Metrowerks CodeWarrior</a>.</p>

<p>After that, the hard drives of the PowerMac G4 were IDE, so finding an USB enclosure was pretty easy, and I already transferred the data on a standard external USB drive. Now, with standardized external storage, virtual machines and Internet backups, information may be never lost. But before that, there is a black hole of unrecoverable data, and sadly that includes this memorable transition from Motorola's 68K to the first PowerPC computer.</p>

<p>Should I bother finding a SCSI to USB adapter, of should I just forget about it and relinquish that data to human memory?</p>
