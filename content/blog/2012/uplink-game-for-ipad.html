<p>For a while I wanted to play the classic PC game <a href="http://www.introversion.co.uk/uplink/">Uplink</a>, but each time I tried a demo for Mac I didn't play too well. Even the latest version on Steam has rendering issues that makes clicking on buttons impossible on my Mac laptop.</p>

<p>So I was relieved to see that the game was available on the iPad. Not only it is identical to the original, but also the latest version ran well, without glitches.</p>

<p>What about the game? It is a game where half of it is discovery by trial and error, and the other half is collecting money by repeating the same jobs. It sounds bad, but the game is actually very well made, and even the repetitive parts are enjoyable. The game has more and more variety and complexity as you progress, and near the end there's an actual plot line where your decisions can make a major difference. So, try a PC demo and see for yourself if that genre is your style.</p>
