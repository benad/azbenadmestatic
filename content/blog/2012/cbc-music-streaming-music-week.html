<p>As <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2012/3/24/the-need-for-djs.html">I mentioned in March</a>, the otherwise-great <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> isn't too good at music discovery. So, as a Canadian citizen, what can I use to stream music from the Internet for free on my iPhone? Apart from streaming (crappy) commercial radio stations, that is? <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>? <em>Nope</em>. <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Spotify</a>? <em>Nada</em>. <a href="https://mog.com/">MOG</a>? <em>Ha</em>! So this week, I'll try to find whatever services are available in Canada, and test one of them each day. The service has to be free and work from my iPhone.</p>

<p><strong>CBC Music</strong></p>

<p>Yay for your tax dollars! While CBC Music is a geographically restricted set of MP3 radio stations, it is varied enough to be considered a streaming music service. It offers roughly 40 stations, with only a few non-commercial interruptions.</p>

<p>The app is basic, and quite frankly I tend to listen to those streams using <a href="http://tunein.com/">TuneIn Radio</a> with a very large buffer, since the streams (especially, or only the classical ones) tend to skip quite a lot otherwise. If it weren't from those skips, the streams are <em>very</em> good. Radio 3 is amazing, and the 10 channels for classical music alone are great. True, the music selection has a clear Canadian bias, and this is not a "latest hits" radio, but then the music selection has an incredible breadth and quality. And, dare I say it, those channels usually are of higher quality than most commercial radio stations.</p>

<p>So, for once something on the Internet on you can't get outside of Canada, and is very good to boot.</p>
