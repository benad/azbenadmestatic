<p>Finally, a JavaScript engine that can fully use Java libraries was made by Oracle, called <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/nashorn/entry/open_for_business">Nashorn</a>. The distinction between Rhino and Nashorn seems to be subtle, but is important: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino">Rhino</a> runs atop the JVM in an isolated way, while Nashorn is a modern scripting engine for JDK 8.</p>

<p>Put a other way, the reason I like so much engines like <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> is that I still have full access to the entire JDK while still being a different programming language. Also, Nashorn makes use of recent JVM changes that greatly helps the performance of typeless scripting languages, specifically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Machine">Da Vinci Machine</a> part of Java 7.</p>

<p>So, I'll look I to it soon, now that some code was released on their public source control release of the development branch of JDK 8, but saying that I learned JavaScript during my vacation doesn't sound impressive...</p>
