<p>For virtual machines I <a href="http://blog.benad.me/2012/9/6/my-server-in-the">like using TurnKey Linux</a>, a small but well packaged Linux distribution. But I&#8217;m still fond of an even smaller Linux distribution called <a href="distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/">Tiny Core Linux</a>, a 12 MB operating system with a full desktop interface.</p>

<p>Of course, at 12 MB, it doesn&#8217;t do much. No WiFi drivers, minimal graphics card support, not even the GNU shell and tools (notice that, for once, Tiny Core isn&#8217;t GNU/Linux at all). But from that and a wired network connection, you can use its package manager to install software from a decent selection. All packages are not even extracted on disk and are actually compressed file system images, something I could <a href="http://blog.benad.me/2005/11/14/linux-package-management-a-solution.html">only dream of seven years ago</a>. This means that it&#8217;s easy to run Tiny Core from a CD while storing user data and software packages on a USB key.</p>

<p>To set up a server, I&#8217;d still prefer TurnKey or GUI-less Debian, but if you ever have to run hundreds of tiny virtual machines, or want to easily make your own flavor of Linux easily, or simply want to run a small and quick Linux machine from a USB key, Tiny Core should do the job.</p>
