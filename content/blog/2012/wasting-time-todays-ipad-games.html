<p>Since I'm on vacation, I wasted a few hours playing some games on my iPad. Here are the ones I recommend.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/the-room/id552039496">The Room</a></em>, not to be confused with the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368226/">movie of the same name</a>, is a nice puzzle game where you try to unlock some contraption device. A bit short, but looks amazing and plays great.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/blowup!!/id454135923">Blowup!!</a></em> is an action puzzler where you simply try to eliminate large enough group of colours. You've surely played on of those flash games where you have a grid of coloured bubbles, and clicking on a group of bubbles of the same colour eliminates them. Well, it's that, but time-based, with a few twists, and amazing music that progressively changes as you get further. It's just an excuse for me to play until I can unlock all that great music.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/interlocked/id554072547">Interlocked</a></em>, a nice sliding blocks puzzle, but this time in 3D. This can be quite challenging.</p>

<p>Finally, <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/wonderputt/id539499112">Wonderputt</a></em>, a nice, single-screen mini-putt game. The graphics look amazing, and the physics are just perfect, making it just as challenging as a real-life mini-putt, but this time with aliens, giant frogs, ski slopes and a rocket spaceship.</p>
