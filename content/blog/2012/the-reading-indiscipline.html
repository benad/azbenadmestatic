<p>I'm about to start reading my "next book", and looking at how much time it took me to read my previous book (5 months for 380 pages), I fear I'm simply not disciplined enough to read books. Maybe it's because my previous was in physical form. When I read articles on the Internet, no problem. Listening to podcasts, no problem either, even at double speed. With audio books, I can do stuff at the same time, so no problem either.</p>

<p>As odd as it sounds, it seems like I can read books faster when I read in small chunks in a combination of platforms (e-book reader + iPhone). Yes, reading needs more focus than just listening to audio, but reading a dozen pages on an iPhone while you're in line waiting for something or on the bus, at the very least keeps you freshly updated in the story rather than shelving it halfway through.</p>

<p>So, Kindle and Kobo it is then. My wish list is getting huge, so I'll select something and start reading this evening.</p>
