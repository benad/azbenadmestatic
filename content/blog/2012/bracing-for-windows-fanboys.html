<p>I thoroughly enjoyed <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/windows-8.html">this post</a> by Jakob Nielsen that dives into Windows 8 usability issues, at least more than <a href="http://blog.benad.me/2012/10/21/windows-modern-ui-usability">just scrolling issues</a>. The issues are well indicated by his post, are easy to experience and reproduce, and are pretty well explained by somebody that's clearly been working in usability for over a decade.</p>

<p>What I found more entertaining was the backlash in the user comments when it was <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/usability-expert-slams-windows-8-disappointing-for-both-novice-and-power-users-7000007599/">reposted on ZDNet</a>. Ad-hominem attacks claiming that Nielsen is just a hack and not a usability expert, that users are stupid if they don't run back to the desktop mode, that all the issues are easily worked around and need a day of training, and so on.</p>

<p>But why? Windows 8 has been on the market for a month now, and as a consumer I don't see the point in trying to defend what is the de-facto monopolistic operating system people are stuck with, unless they go out of their way to buy a Mac or install Linux. Windows 8 is now the <em>default</em>, so why would anybody fanatically defend it, unless you work for Microsoft, is beyond me. Oh well, at least it's not as bad as YouTube comments.</p>
