<p>There are a few non-mainstream software tools I&#8217;d like to try when I have some spare time, alternatives for currently popular tools.</p>

<p>First, Linux isn&#8217;t the only open-source UNIX kernel out there. While I&#8217;ve used Solaris a lot, I never tried BSD beyond its toolset since early versions of Mac OS X. It just so happens that <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/releases/formal-6/NetBSD-6.0.html">version 6 was released this week</a>. In the past I ended up avoiding BSD variants because of the lack of driver support and how they wouldn&#8217;t work well in a virtual machine.</p>

<p>Also, while I use a lot <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU Screen</a>, it tends to be bulky and complicated. It is primarily a terminal emulator, but I always end up using it purely for detached terminal sessions. Well, from OpenBSD, there is the tool called <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a>, a terminal multiplexer <em>first</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, just so that I can feel even <em>more</em> like a hipster with computers, I&#8217;d like to try out <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/">Z shell</a>. There used to be a time (decades ago?) when there was a healthy competition between various shell alternatives. Over time BASH mostly won, with Tcsh second (on legacy Mac OS X and BSD). But then, both annoy me, not as badly as DOS, but still. I heard that Z was more decent, so I&#8217;ll try it out.</p>
