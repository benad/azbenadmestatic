<p>For a while I was planning to buy the writing software tool <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php?show=features&amp;#38;amp;platform=mac">Scrivener</a> for Mac. I wasn&#8217;t certain between buying the software from the Mac store, or directly from the company at the same price. By buying directly from the developers, I would support them more, since Apple takes a 30% cut on the Mac store, far more than Paypal&#8217;s 10&#8211;15% for example. And then, a few weeks later, I see that it is part of the <a href="http://macheist.com/">MacHeist 4 Bundle</a>.</p>

<p>The bundle is at $30, with 25% going to some charities, as if it was a way to make us feel better to be so cheap. Now, that would save me $15, and I&#8217;d get a bunch of other software with it I may not use, plus the charity thing. Still, what about supporting the developers? I already wanted to buy the software on its own directly from them at $45 <em>just</em> to show my support, whereas with the bundle they would get only a small fraction of that $30.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll just ignore the bundle, and buy it independently.</p>
