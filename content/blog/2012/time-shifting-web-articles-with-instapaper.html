<div class='posterous_autopost'>So, reading your Twitter feed in a short one-minute break between your desk and the bathroom at work you found an interesting link to a lengthy article, but no time to read it! What if you could bookmark it for "to read" and read it at your leaguer on your iPad or Kindle? <p /> Again, the "Reading List" feature on Safari and iOS from Apple was directly inspired be the Instapaper ( <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">http://www.instapaper.com/</a> ) service. Integrated in a large list of browsers, software and apps ( <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/extras">http://www.instapaper.com/extras</a> ) when you want to read an article later you simply send it to Instapaper. What it offers more than bookmarks, beyond its near ubiquity in a large quantity of apps, is that once marks you'll be able to read the articles on Instapaper's site or own apps in a newspaper-like format, with no pictures or annoying ads. Additionally, it can send articles to read directly to your Kindle, perfect for reading long articles without wearing your eyes. <p /> It also comes with a slew of additional features, such as "Liking" an article to share it with your friends and even sending the link to Twitter or Facebook, an RSS feed (thus having something like a folder of bookmarks in your browser), an email address where you can post long text, and a few export options. <p /> Of course, it's free, with a "Pro" account that will let you search in the text of your articles and support sending and more options of sending articles to your Kindle. The iPhone and iPad apps are also not free but have a great user interface and are a joy to use.</div>
