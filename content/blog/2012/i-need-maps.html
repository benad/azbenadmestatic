<div class='posterous_autopost'>I am now about 40% through the audio book of "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich", by William L. Shirer. Before, I knew not much of World War II, and this (very) lengthy book seems comprehensive enough that after reading it I'll know more than enough about it. <p /> The problem with the audio book form is that it challenged my memory of European geography a bit too much, and so now I have to look at a few maps from time to time. At least finding WWII maps online is not too much of a problem, unlike made up fantasy worlds like the Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin.</div>
