<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Seems like that, with Windows 8, Microsoft is willing to bet a lot on tablets and the Metro interface. Which seems at odds with their two main products, Windows for PCs and Office, both of whom are awkward on anything but a PC. The same can be said of Ubuntu and Apple&rsquo;s placing more and more elements of iOS on their Macs.</p>  <p>Is it because at last we are willing to admit that computers are just too difficult to use, and that we&rsquo;re willing to forgo general purpose computers for closeted devices for the sake of convenience? Â As for PCs, with Dell&rsquo;s and HP&rsquo;s saying that they want to leave the consumer market for business, are we willing to admit that PCs are for work <em>only</em>?</p>  <p>I&rsquo;m a little bit torn between the fact that I consider only a custom-built PC with an open-source OS a <em>real</em> PC, whereas I recommended to my father to transition to an iPad. There&rsquo;s a transition towards &ldquo;dumbing down&rdquo; computing devices far more than ever, and I&rsquo;m still unsure if it&rsquo;s for the better or worse. That, or maybe everybody&rsquo;s broke and have less money to spend on computers, so it&rsquo;s not really a choice. The next two years (or the next economic crash) will tell.</p></div>
