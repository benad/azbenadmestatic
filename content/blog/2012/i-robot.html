<p>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot">I, Robot</a>", the 1950 collection of short stories by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, is an almost-utopia science fiction about, well, robots. I say "almost-utopia" because they deal about "bugs" that robots have in relations to their pre-programmed "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">three laws of robotics</a>".</p>

<p>Rather than being gimmicky, those 3 laws become the central and thorough focus of the stories, not only about how the robots can be "glitched" by them but also how they interact with humanity. Beyond the interesting moral and philosophical implications, the stories are quite entertaining, at times funny, suspenseful or intriguing.</p>

<p>And this is want I liked best about the book: The stories are superbly well told. Even if you're not into science fiction or you just don't care about it, you will have great fun discovering each story, and it the end not only you will have enjoyed the read but also come out with some interesting "what if" questions. Oh, and the recent movie with the same title is crap compared to the book.</p>
