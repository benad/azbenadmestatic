<p>Few software developments tools that I used in university over ten years ago stayed in my &#8220;toolbox&#8221; after all those years. Often it&#8217;s simply because they&#8217;re not applicable anymore to the kind of code that I&#8217;m currently writing. Suddenly, <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a> came back into my &#8220;work&#8221;toolbox&quot; this week, and I was surprised at how better it became over time.</p>

<p>I had to document a bunch of C# objects, so I looked to see what was the C# equivalent to the powerful <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html">JavaDoc</a> (because, of course, C# is just a massive &#8220;me too&#8221; of Java made by Microsoft). Well, it seems that C# standardized around <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/">NDoc</a> since it is natively supported in Visual Studio. Frankly, it pales compared to JavaDoc, and its syntax sucks.</p>

<p>So I looked back at Doxygen, and it was just as amazing as I remembered it. The Windows build of Doxygen even comes with a quite nice graphical tool to generate and run new <code>Doxyfile</code>s. The multi-page RTF document looked amazing, and I remembered how much I liked being able to create free-form pages of documentation (not tied to any specific class or function) using pretty much the same syntax. Doxygen now supports Markdown and far more programming languages than just C and C++. Doxygen almost made writing documentation fun.</p>
