<p>I had to wake up from hibernation my Windows XP virtual machine after 7 months. The amount of software updates it triggered was brutal. It took 3 reboots and 2 hours to go through all the updates, and all that on a pretty fast virtual machine host.</p>

<p>Come to think about it, no other operating system wasted so much of my time updating stuff. Service Pack 2, Service Pack 3, Internet Explorer 7 then 8, 4 different versions of .Net (it is to note every single security update for these are significantly slower), and countless tiny "critical" security fixes. True, there are maybe just as many updates for Mac OS X over the years, but they never felt that slow or obtrusive, especially since many of those updates were actual version changes that brought new features.</p>

<p>No wonder users are fed up of software updates. And it's not just with computers now... Even Blu-Ray players have those annoying updates. I'm not sure if there is a solution, but now it seems that software updates is the new email spam.</p>
