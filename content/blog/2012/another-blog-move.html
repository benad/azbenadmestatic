<p>So, I'll be moving my blog again. Kind of. Actually, it's just a free upgrade on <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>, from version 5 to version 6. While the move requires some effort and doesn't have feature parity, the upgrade is free.</p>

<p>As a version 5 user, I don't really have to upgrade, but then I still wasn't quite fond of my current, slightly customized template. I created a new account for version 6 (using my email address as the user name instead, and then linking the two accounts), and instinctively tried to find a matching template that would have a sidebar on the right. I couldn't find any, but then their free-form block templates allow you to fully customize non-blog pages, effectively moving that long column of months to another page. Actually, they have a new, much better calendar-style widget for historical posts.</p>

<p>Overall, while I'd like the new version to offer more templates for blogging considering that they're less flexible than before, I far refer the new version. You can take a look at <a href="http://benad-test.squarespace.com/">my test site</a>, a compared to <a href="http://blog.benad.me/">the older template</a> I think it looks far better. I still have a few tweaks to make, and I then should be able to make the move within a week or two.</p>
