<p>A new version of <a href="http://www.turnkeylinux.org/">TurnKey Linux</a> was recently released, and this time this version 12 is based of Debian 6, not Ubuntu 12. While the software packages from Debian Stable tend to be a bit too old for my taste, especially for Mercurial, the result is still rock-solid.</p>

<p>In the past I tended to skip past the various <a href="https://hub.turnkeylinux.org/">commercial offerings of TurnKey</a> with its integration with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>, but with Amazon's such aggressive pricing, starting at only $0.02 per hour, having a small Linux server "in the cloud" is tempting to say the least.</p>

<p>I still have other priorities for now. First, LogMeIn is so unreliable on a headless Mac server that I need to find another inexpensive solution, and I don't like much the prospect of making SSH publicly accessible without finding ways to harden it (does Mac 10.8 support multiple SSH instances on different ports?). So, let's start with servers I already own before building up new ones.</p>
