<p>As <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/10/29/scott-forstall-reportedly-forced-out-of-apple/">Scott Forstall is pushed out of leading iOS development at Apple</a>, some choice quotes are coming about about his management, including his &#8220;abrasive style&#8221;. <em>Hey</em>, that&#8217;s me!</p>

<p>I the middle of a development rush, it is difficult to understand why I become so cold, direct, angry or <em>abrasive</em>. Most of the time, people don&#8217;t want to understand the source of the anger, even if that anger was for legitimate reasons. You might even say that anger is <em>never</em> legitimate, but the hard truth is that sometimes being &#8220;abrasive&#8221; is needed to move things forward. The thing is that a lot of people may not be in position to fully understand the immediate danger of some situation, so in a way emotion is a tool that can help communicate that, if sporadically used.</p>

<p>That, or maybe I&#8217;m just rationalizing my asshole-ness in the workplace. Either way, good or wrong, my emotions ends up not changing much, and in resignation I end up fixing everything myself. Maybe that&#8217;s the difference between an &#8220;abrasive style&#8221; of management versus of engineering: The latter gets things done, the former just ends up annoying everybody.</p>
