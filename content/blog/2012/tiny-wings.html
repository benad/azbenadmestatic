<p>I'm typically distrustful of online reviews on iOS apps, even more of iOS games, so it was quite a stretch for me to buy the game "Tiny Wings" for the iPad. At $3, it is three times more expensive than the iPhone version. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of such a cheap game.</p>

<p>It's essentially a racing game, where the only control is when you press you retract your wings to go down slopes faster (and up slopes slower). You're facings against the sunset, and by flying from one island to another (levels), you can give yourself a few extra seconds of flying time. There's also a competitive mode against 3 other birds, and a two-player mode.</p>

<p>The presentation is great, and the music is soothing. Which is a good thing considering that this is, after all, a quite challenging and unforgiving racing game. It's not too difficult in the earlier islands, but as you progress it can become really stressful. For a single-button game, I found it quite enjoyable, with many challenges, achievements and things to discover that makes the $3 worth it. </p>
