<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/25632031">The Ten&hellip;</a>&rdquo; by (<em>the</em>) Steve Martin is a compendium of some messages he posted on his <a href="http://twitter.com/stevemartintogo">Twitter account</a>. It is a somewhat small book (unsurprising given that Twitter messages are limited to 140 characters), but it is quite funny and worth the read.</p>  <p>To give you an idea of his humor and style when using Twitter, here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMartinToGo/statuses/188780414863818752">recent example</a>: &ldquo;So beautiful today in New York. Each leaf on every tree bloomed with life. Every person wore a friendly smile. I wish I had been there&rdquo;.</p>  <p>In a way, the short form of Twitter fits Martin&rsquo;s humor style, and this is why after he found how to use Twitter he is now using that as a new comedic platform. At times, even the replies are as funny (or funnier) as Martin&rsquo;s messages. So, two things: Buy his book, and follow him on Twitter.</p></div>
