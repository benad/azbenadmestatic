<p>After a week of trying free music streaming sites that are available in Canada, I think I found enough to satisfy my needs. For something closer to a radio station, there&#8217;s <a href="http://music.cbc.ca/">CBC Music</a>. For more randomness, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jango.com/">Jango</a>. For great curation, there&#8217;s <a href="http://songza.com/">Songza</a>. And for user-made playlists out of any uploaded MP3 file, there&#8217;s <a href="http://8tracks.com/">8tracks</a>.</p>

<p>True, for a while I lamented the lack of Pandora and Spotify, but then I don&#8217;t like being forced to login with Facebook or pay to remove ads. I still use <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> as my &#8220;go-to&#8221; service, and frankly it&#8217;s difficult to beat with the little amount of choice we have here. Still the fact that here we still have such choice for free, legal music is testament that the music industry successfully adapted to this new market.</p>

<p>As for the TV and movie industry, well, they still suck. But then I don&#8217;t watch TV anymore and I dislike going to cinema theaters, so it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m losing much&#8230;</p>
