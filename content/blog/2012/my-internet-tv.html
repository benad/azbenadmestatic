<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>As I mentioned in an <a href="http://benad-blog.posterous.com/selling-out">earlier post</a>, I&rsquo;m not really watching &ldquo;real&rdquo; TV much anymore. During weekdays I barely have an hour of spare time a day, and I already spend much of that time reading books and web sites like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>. Yet, I still have a little spare time to watch TV, but more precisely Internet TV.</p>  <p>Having mostly avoided traditional TV for over a year now, The first thing I notice is how much budget they have to spend on such crap. True, Internet TV is quite low budget, yet I feel that given an international audience and highly targeted demographics, the results are of higher <em>content</em> quality than almost all over-the-air and cable television.</p>  <p>Even though I still recommend using a computer for Internet TV, having your computer connected to a large screen mimics quite well a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; setup with a cable box. In my case, I use an Apple Mac Mini with an Apple Remote and the software <a href="http://www.iospirit.com/products/remotebuddy/">Remote Buddy</a>. I download &ldquo;videocasts&rdquo; (free video podcasts) using iTunes, and watch YouTube using either <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/leanback">YouTube Leanback</a> using Google Chrome in full screen.</p>  <p>What do I watch? From the &ldquo;This Week in Tech&rdquo; network I watch <a href="http://twit.tv/ipad">iPad Today</a>, <a href="http://twit.tv/fr">Frame Rate</a> for news about the movie and tv industry, and <a href="http://twit.tv/byb">Before You Buy</a> for tech reviews. For video game reviews I watch <a href="http://revision3.com/newchallenger">New Challenger</a>. For movie reviews I watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/whattheflickshow">What The Flick</a> and <a href="http://redlettermedia.com/half-in-the-bag/">Half in the Bag</a>. For French shows that don&rsquo;t suck, I use <a href="http://tou.tv">Tou.tv</a> (Enqu√®te, RBO 3.0 and a few others from time to time). And finally, just for fun, I watch cheap gadget and toy reviews by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ashens">Ashens</a>.</p>  <p>See, why resort to piracy or paying for cable? I have more than enough with ad-supported free Internet videos&hellip;</p></div>
