<p>So, Diablo III was released this week. OK, for all the young kids out there that waited in line to buy, how many of you finished Diablo, Diablo II and its expansion pack Lord of Destruction? <em>(Diablo I's expansion Hellfire was released on Windows only, so I never played it.)</em> Yet, I think I'll skip out on this game. It may be much better than Diablo II, but I just don't have the time or the computer hardware for it. Also, it's not original enough to warrant my attention.</p>

<p>I feel the same way about the Zelda series. As it progressed, I just had less and less patience for what seemed like minor to medium iterations of the same genre. Yes, it's better each time, but can I spend another 30-40 hours on it?</p>

<p>Effectively, it may be not as much that I have less spare time (especially compared to the nightmarish rush that was university for me), but that I branched out into so many other activities that I simply have to be more selective of where I invest my time. So, given the choice between all those incredibly original yet short free "indie" games and a massive blockbuster that will suck all my attention, I'll root for the underdogs.</p>
