<p>Today I was expecting the release of the <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">Opera 12</a> desktop web browser, but it didn't happen. The reason why I'm so aware of their release cycle is because the <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/">Opera Desktop Team</a> regularly post publicly their beta and release candidate releases.</p>

<p>While making non-final releases public is not an unusual thing, their way of doing so is quite interesting. They make a new release candidate available through a blog post, and comments are open below the post to let anyone post feedback or bugs about the release. A kind of free QA team. Glancing at the comments one can see how many bugs were introduced, and how stable is the new candidate.</p>

<p>Of course Firefox has a more robust process, but I wonder if something as informal as blog posts and comments could work in a smaller scale. True, by today's standards making a web browser from scratch is a huge undertaking, but for small open-source projects this model of using blog posts to get feedback could work quite well.</p>
