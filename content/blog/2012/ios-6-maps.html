<p>Oh no! Apple’s own mapping solution that replaced Google Maps in iOS 6 isn’t as good! Apple even <a href="http://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/">wrote an apology letter</a>! Panic! Controversy!</p><p>Well, using the web browser you can still access <a href="https://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> and <a href="http://m.maps.nokia.com/">Nokia maps</a> in Safari. They work fine, and free. The UI isn’t as good as a native app, but hey, the important thing is the maps and good directions. There are also a few map apps in the store, including more expensive maps that can fully run offline.</p><p>For transit in Montréal, since it’s not part of Apple’ maps, you have <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/stm/id462979785?l=fr&amp;mt=8">STM’s own app</a>, which isn’t yet integrated with Apple’s maps, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/hopstop-transit-directions/id303217144?l=fr&amp;mt=8">HopStop</a>, with better directions and maps, and integrated with Apple’s maps.</p><p>By the way, the 3D maps in Apple’s maps are absolutely amazing here in Montréal, so I guess the map quality really depends on where you live. Still, it’s not perfect, so panic!</p>
