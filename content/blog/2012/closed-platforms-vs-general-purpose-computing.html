<p>Some are <em>shocked</em> that <a href="http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/slashdot/eqWf/~3/4aaY4HMwg08/no-opt-out-for-ads-on-new-kindle-fires">you can't turn off ads on the new Kindle Fires</a>, which may explain their low price and unavailability outside of the US. Using ads to partly subsidize a device is still quite rare, but not unprecedented. Yet it still feels like an affront to many users since they expects tablets to be a different form of a computer. They're not.</p>

<p>For almost as long as there were "Personal Computers", there were specialized devices using microprocessors that were not general-purpose. The most popular of such devices are video game consoles. And while hackers have great fun breaking the security systems of those consoles to make them load "homebrew games", that every device you buy has to allow users unfettered access is not a right. Software in the context of those devices is still closed and dependent on the economics of its market, and that's just the way things are. Console wars, Android vs iOS... Those battles will always exist.</p>

<p>The thing is that, at least for the time being, there are still general-computer devices that do <em>not</em> require authorization of any kind to run software anybody wrote. This is the reason I'm so adamant to write iOS apps, since I would need some kind of developer access just to be allowed to run software I wrote on my own, err <em>licensed</em> device.</p>

<p>I make this a crucial point because the "freedom" to run any software you wrote is something that even Microsoft wants to move away from with "Modern" Windows 8 apps. The same can be implied with the Mac app store. Yet I suspect this recent wave of "app stores" may just be another repeating cycle. Once you look at the sheer size of some large corporation development teams for internal software, or just <em>the web</em>, the need for general-purpose computing will remain. This is why once you start shopping for "enterprise-ready" computer and servers, Linux support becomes common. Last I checked, IBM, Dell and even HP are fleeing the device-centered consumer market and running towards enterprise, which is almost exclusively general-purpose. With that money alone I'm not too worried that general-computing could go away, though <em>personal</em> and affordable computing may slowly fade away.</p>
