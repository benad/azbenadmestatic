<p>I like "independent" video games, meaning games made by independent, small companies. Also, I like <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>. So, combined, I like the <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Indie Bundle</a>, now the 7th bundle. The games are all cross-platform, many come with the full soundtrack, and even while giving some money to charities it's pretty cheap. Actually, you can pay whatever you want, but I typically pay $20 to $40, considering the quality of the games I get.</p>

<p>There is a big disadvantage to those bundles, though: When am I going to have to time to play all of these? Those games are award-winning and long, so I can't easily toss most of them aside just because only one of the games was interesting to me. Oh well...</p>
