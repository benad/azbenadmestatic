<div class='posterous_autopost'>Starting with the fifth movie of the Harry Potter movies, David Yates consistently directed the rest of the series. I say "consistently" because they do feel alike in style, a reprieve compared to the changing styles introduced by the third and fourth movies. Also, unlike the nearly direct scene per scene adaptations of the first half of the series, your can feel the struggle to fit in a story that is far bigger than the average 140-minutes screen time. And yet, the increased "adaptation" for screen works well enough that viewers that haven't read the books (like me) can still appreciate the more "streamlined" story. It is to note that at this point the fans are so rabid that even if Yates to an average job his movies would be blockbusters, and yet it genuinely feels like at the very least Yates does a good effort to make movies that stand on their own as artistic works. <p /> The fifth movie grows the Harry Potter universe more with this "order of the Phoenix", and intermingles that story line with one about a school curriculum reformation. The latter was quite enjoyable on its own, yet seems somewhat disconnected from the former which ties in with the overall series' story arc. Some annoying aspects that started to be introduced are Harry having "visions" because he is somehow connected to Voldemort, and the use of teleportation. Both work well as plot devices on paper, but seem glaringly cheap when displayed on screen. Also, Yates loves his blacks, making almost-dark scenes difficult to follow. I even had to turn up the brightness from the BD player since even the TV couldn't cope with the darkness. This made some sets, like the whole end confrontation (in the dark with shelves of glass balls and the battle that follows) not only confusing, but feel like it was just a clever way to save money on the sets. In the end, it is an enjoyable movie, but not much more. <p /> With the sixth movie you can tell that Yates is more comfortable with it's directing style and with adapting the book's story. The story feels far less "all over the place", and is maybe the first story of the series that focuses almost entirely on the main story arc of the series. Thus this story cannot be enjoyed much unless you had at least partially watched or read the previous books. One annoyance, though, is that the disparity between the age of the characters in the script and the actors becomes too distracting, or maybe that's just me. Otherwise, this movie has some of the best acting, art direction and story line of the movies. Overall, this movie is one of the best of the series, after the thrid movie, and makes it nearly impossible to not want to watch the last book.</div>
