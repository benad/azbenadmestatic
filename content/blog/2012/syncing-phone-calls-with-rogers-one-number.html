<p>You know, when <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2012/11/27/automatic-bookmarks">yesterday</a> I mentioned synchronization services for bookmarks of long form media, I wouldn't be thinking that it's possible to do the same with live mobile phone calls. Well, it seems like it's possible, at least with <a href="http://www.rogers.com/">Rogers</a>.</p>

<p>They made something called <a href="https://www.rogersonenumber.ca/welcome/">Rogers One Number</a>, which is essentially a free VoIP and text messaging service over Internet for Canadian phone numbers for Rogers cellphone customers. They've made applications for PC, Mac and now even the iPad. Something that impressed me is how it behaves when you receive a call: Both the cellphone and Rogers One app will notify you, and you can answer the call on either.</p>

<p>But what if you answer the call on the cellphone by mistake and wished you could instead use the free call minutes of the iPad app? Well, using the code <code>*11</code> you can transfer a live call to the iPad. It worked fine in my tests. At the very least, I find it a better alternative to Skype when having to do long calls from home to work conference calls. I can also see how this service can be used, with a home PC, to make you cellphone your primary phone number and drop the landline.</p>
