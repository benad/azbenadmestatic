<p>If I could summarize my software development year, I'd day that this year was when I became a full-blown Microsoft Windows developer. Ugh. I had more fun playing with the bowels of Perl than spending all my time in the MSDN search box.</p>

<p>Oh, and the chaos of Windows 8. Nice kernel, nice shell, boots fast, but again messed up some drivers (don't get me started with "connected standby"), and, oh buy, that formally-known-as-Metro crap.</p>

<p>It's really not fun being stuck behind countless APIs and feeling like you're fighting their limitations. Or doing hacks for an OS that was released <em>weeks</em> ago. Also, the dev I was doing was so heavy that I had boot in Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro rather than using VMware, so I spent weeks away from normal Mac usage.</p>

<p>I'll link to this video as a summary of my frustrations with Windows 8: "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTYet-qf1jo">Windows 8: The Animated Evaluation</a>". This won't be noticed by almost all PC users, but for anybody with an iota of background in UI usability, you'll be endlessly annoyed by Windows 8. And Visual Studio 2012 looks like crap.</p>
