<p>As I was playing with the demo version of <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>, I just realized that any large writing effort requires considerable amount of work. There&#8217;s research, planning, multiple drafts of not only the text but also synopsis, and more. If your work has some kind of story, there are character back stories, locations, historical settings, and more.</p>

<p>Sure, I can throw everything at Evernote, but that will tend to create a mess, since you can&#8217;t group notes beyond notebooks and tagging. Or, as I originally planned, place everything in well structured plain text files, but over time the lack of tagging and meta-data makes cross referencing difficult. So, at a glance, Scrivener does offer a much better set of tools for writing projects, yet it is so powerful that it doesn&#8217;t fit well (or at all) with mobile devices.</p>

<p>Many may dismiss the idea that any writing can be done from a phone or even a tablet, but like small Moleskine notebooks it is just too convenient to be able to jot down something at all times. You can&#8217;t predict when you&#8217;ll get an idea, insight or inspiration. In that sense, typing down something in a cloud-based note taking App like Simplenote or any of those Dropbox-synced text editors can make very good &#8220;inbox&#8221; inputs. And then I might even try using the Nebulous App to view RTFs produced by Scrivener synced into Dropbox.</p>

<p>As you can see, my problem is that it can be difficult to define a good work process before you even attempted it once.</p>
