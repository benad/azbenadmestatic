<p>From time to time, I peruse the local news about what's going on with the elections in Québec, and that reminds me why I don't watch TV anymore. Even local newspapers. It is so trashy, superficial, manipulative, full of propaganda... It is as if I have a profound allergy to bullshit, and our local media is so toxic I have a visceral reaction the second I get in contact with it.</p>

<p>Also, the mediocrity of the various party platforms remind me how gullible is the general population. I mean, really? You're going to vote for <em>that</em>? It feels like that over time all intellectuals were weeded out of politics, and only communications dropouts remain. The amount of ideological conviction now needed is zero. Add in multiple forms of cultural intransigence and regionalism, and whatever sanity could have remained is now long gone. If US politics is like "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odd_Couple">The Odd Couple</a>", in Québec with the insane number of political parties it feels like "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_a_Mad,_Mad,_Mad,_Mad_World">Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</a>".</p>
