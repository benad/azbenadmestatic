<p>I looked at this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQ0fLN63UE">public disagreement over a firing</a>, and it reminds me how easily I can become an egotistical asshole, building a fan base to justify my actions. Even if you disagree with your employer, you don't have to make it public with such venom on the Internet, even less badly burn bridges with litigation threats.</p>

<p>What I found is that this happens more with moody, creative people. And, in a way, focusing that creativity and emotions on coding is a good exit valve for me. A computer is not a person with feelings (yet). If the code I write is bad, then that code is shit, and I won't take it personally if somebody else points it out to me. Why waste so much emotional energy on personal ambition, on blowing up personal disagreements, on egos, on cliques and on a personal image solely made to impress others? Instead, I use my creativity to be ruthlessly honest about the quality of what I do, and I will take it personally if I was lazy in my work or if I ran away from my responsibilities.</p>
