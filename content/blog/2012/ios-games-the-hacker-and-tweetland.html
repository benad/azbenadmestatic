<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Two quick IPhone game reviews.</p>  <p>&ldquo;The Hacker&rdquo; is a small but enjoyable puzzle game in the style of old-school computer hacking. There are 4 main puzzle types: Moving multiple bugs at the same time until they all stand in specific positions, a simple memory game, a game where you direct an electricity ball through wires avoiding enemies, an a bit-flipping &ldquo;decryption&rdquo; game. If you&rsquo;re stuck, you can spend XPs to skip some puzzles, and you can unlock side games to gain XPs too. It&rsquo;s not too difficult, somewhat short, but the side games are pretty good and breaks a bit the monotony of going though puzzles all the time. Well worth the $1.</p>  <p>TweetLand is a racing game where you need to avoid cars while you can crash them on the side to gain points. The twist? The in-game &ldquo;events&rdquo; and items appear when tweets on Twitter are done containing certain keywords. For example, a tweet with the word &ldquo;health&rdquo; add a health box, &ldquo;meteor&rdquo; drops a meteor in the game, and so on. And this is not faked: At the end of the level you can see all the tweets that produced the events, and yes I verified a few of them and they&rsquo;re real. The game can be quite challenging at times, but it is so &ldquo;meta&rdquo; and based on real-life events you&rsquo;ll just come back to it for the insanity of the events, and the fact that people actually wrote those key words&hellip; Absolutely worth the $2.</p></div>
