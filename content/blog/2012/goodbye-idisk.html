<p>And so, by the end of day today, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDisk">iDisk</a>, part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MobileMe#iDisk">MobileMe</a>, will be shut down. When I fist used iTools, meaning when I first had an Internet connection, this "storage in the cloud" before we called it a "cloud" was the killer feature of the free iTools, after that insanely cool <a href="mailto:benad@mac.com">benad@mac.com</a> I still use to this day.</p>

<p>Originally at 50MB, iDisk was small compared to today's standards, yet for some free service it was amazing. Also, files stored in the <code>Sites</code> directory was publicly accessible through a standard HTTP address, with no ads whatsoever. Compared to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">GeoCities</a>, this was exceptional.</p>

<p>In the end, though, it couldn't compete. Even if I already backed up all my files a year ago, just to be safe, and in a final defiant act, I downloaded ZIP archives of all my files and uploaded them safely on Microsoft's own <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/skydrive/home">SkyDrive</a>.</p>
