<p>For over a decade, Outlook was for me a synonym of bloated work email. And now <a href="http://outlook.com/">the Outlook.com site</a> is now the replacement of the venerable free email service Hotmail, also known as "Live Mail". It doesn't feel "enterprisey" enough for me. It's a simple UI, with feature parity with Hotmail, but with a few nice shortcuts.</p>

<p>Compared to the web interface of <a href="http://icloud.com/">iCloud</a>, which insist in mimicking the Mac's Mail program, and the visually spammy and ad-ridden Yahoo! Mail, I don't know why anybody would complain about the "new" Outlook email service. Even Gmail feels <em>way</em> too complicated to use for novice users and feels like it was made for people like me first.</p>

<p>So, it's free, it's easy to use, and you get a new shiny @outlook.com email address (quite frankly the old @hotmail.com started to feel unsophisticated to say the least). Mine's <a href="mailto:benad@outlook.com">benad@outlook.com</a>, which is still not as cool as <a href="mailto:benad@me.com">benad@me.com</a>, but way better than <a href="mailto:benad84@gmail.com">benad84@gmail.com</a>. Does it show that I'm quite confident of the anti-spam capabilities of all those services?</p>
