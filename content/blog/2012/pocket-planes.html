<p><a href="http://www.nimblebit.com/">Niblebit</a>, makers of the popular iOS game <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/tiny-tower/id422667065?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=0JkCNyaaKoo">Tiny Tower</a>, recently released a new game called "<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/pocket-planes/id491994942?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=0JkCNyaaKoo">Pocket Planes</a>". It offers a nice change compared to <em>towers</em>, which in a way was a variation on those "<a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2012/3/5/work-games-or-the-economics-of-farmville.html">work games</a>". Pocket Planes adds enough complexity to make it closer to a "sim" game.</p>

<p>You essentially control a fleet of planes that make profit transporting either cargo or people. The greater the distance, the greater the payout. Of course, longer distances involve greater fuel costs depending on the weight of the plane, and take more "real world" time to arrive to destination. As you get to higher "levels" you can buy access to more airports, and eventually greater airports with more capacity for bigger, trans-continental planes.</p>

<p>The added complexity meant the game could have afforded either a longer tutorial (that could be replayed), or even an in-game manual. Otherwise, after ten minutes of exploration you'll understand everything, and the game becomes both enjoyable and addictive. As for the "paying real money for in-game money", it's well balanced and if you're a bit patient you can easily play without any in-game purchase. So, it's a really nice game, and I recommend it.</p>
