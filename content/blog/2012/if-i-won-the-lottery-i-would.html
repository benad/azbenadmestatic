<p>A quick question for a quick post: If you won a nearly infinite amount of money in the lottery, what would you do?</p>

<p>The answer to this question, if honestly and realistically answered, can be quite telling of what you really like, and what you actually value. Some may answer that any amount wouldn't be enough, because what they like is making more money. Some may endlessly travel, because they'll never find a place "good enough" for them. And many more would just fall into endless gluttony, lust, laziness, and whatever animalistic aspect of ourselves.</p>

<p>A few are crazy enough to want to create stuff endlessly, in search or craftsmanship and artistic perfection. Even poor they would do the same. Actually, money wouldn't make much difference, other that no time is wasted on jobs that don't align with that creativity.</p>
