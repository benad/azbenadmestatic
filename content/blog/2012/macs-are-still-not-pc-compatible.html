<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>A few days ago I feebly attempted to create a live Linux USB for my MacBook Pro (mid-2010 model). And, oh boy that failed miserably.</p>  <p>While there is no issue booting from a CD, this can cause a problem on newer Mac models that don&rsquo;t have a CD drive at all. In those cases, simply <code>dd</code>-ing the ISO (or converted to DMG) file to a USB doesn&rsquo;t work at all. Why? Well, I can&rsquo;t say exactly why, but essentially, Macs do not use BIOS but use EFI.</p>  <p>If you don&rsquo;t know, the whole reason why Apple made &ldquo;Bootcamp&rdquo; was to support a BIOS emulation layer within EFI to allow booting Windows. While there are some version of Windows Vista and higher that can boot on EFI, they don&rsquo;t tend to be as supported (driver-wise) as BIOS-booting.</p>  <p>The crux of the issue, then, is that if there is such a thing nowadays as &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_compatible">PC-compatible</a>&rdquo;, it essentially means x86-compatible and BIOS, and Macs are still not PCs in that sense. So a vast majority of Linux distributions cannot boot as-is on a USB key on a Mac.</p>  <p>I found some kind of solution <a href="http://tillmail.de/wordpress/436">here</a> that allows booting an ISO file from a USB key with no need to burn a CD. It ripped apart the internals of <a href="http://refit.sourceforge.net/">rEFit</a> to do so, but it seems to work. I said &ldquo;seems&rdquo; because there were still video driver issues with Ubuntu, and I haven&rsquo;t tried any other Linux distro yet, but at least <em>something</em> was booting.</p></div>
