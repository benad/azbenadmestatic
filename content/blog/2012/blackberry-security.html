<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>One of the truism in the world of cellphones is that Blackberry is secure, or at least implied more secure than Android and iPhone. And nothing annoys me as much as that falsehood.</p>  <p>First, if you&rsquo;re not using it with the &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; server, then it&rsquo;s definitively less secure than a normal IMAP+SSL email client. Why? Simply because you give all your credentials to Blackberry that will access your normal email accounts from their servers. Kind of like Opera Mini, but for email. Essentially, a single point of failure for a governmental agency to get all your emails and track you.</p>  <p>And even if you pay through the nose for the enterprise version of their server, the security depends of trusting their audits of their closed-source encryption. Maybe it has backdoors, maybe it has security holes, you&rsquo;ll never know. Until their enterprise messaging server becomes open source, why trust them?</p>  <p>At best, the blackberry infrastructure could be trustworthy and as secure as IMAP and SSL. At worst, it&rsquo;s filled with backdoors and holes. So, why is it considered more secure? The competition is a collection of proven, free and peer-reviewed Internet standards.</p>  <p>Simply put, Blackberry&rsquo;s &ldquo;security&rdquo; is complete bullshit. Until it can connect on my own IMAP server that I compiled myself using my own SSL certificate, I won&rsquo;t even consider it for a serious secure solution.</p></div>
