<p>Something that impacted my work directly: How come Windows doesn't have a software updated infrastructure like on Linux, of at the very least like the Mac App Store for "sandboxed" applications? It really feels like every single Windows application must re-invent the wheel just to be able to present to the user timely software updates.</p>

<p>And before you say that on Linux package management is restricted to what is supported by distribution, no, that's incorrect. Both RPM and Debian packages, the two most popular package managers, allow users to specifiy multiple software "sources", which can be also a third-party software company. For example, on Ubuntu the Opera web browser adds Opera (the company) as a software source, that way updates for Opera are picked up automatically by the Ubuntu update process.</p>

<p>Maybe Microsoft will fix that. Or maybe they'll do it in a half-assed way by just supporting updates for Metro applications.</p>
