<p>I'm getting tired this evening (with <a href="http://fetenationale.qc.ca/">Saint-Jean Batiste's celebrations</a> and all), so why not review a few puzzle games for iOS I liked.</p>

<p><strong>:Shift:</strong> and <strong>:Shift!2:</strong></p>

<p>A platform game with a twist. Originally a <a href="http://armorgames.com/play/751/shift">web Flash game</a>, it is based on the idea that when you press "shift" your character goes from the "walk in white, block on black" environment to the "walk in black, block on white" mirror environment. The iOS games aren't as <em>smooth</em> as the original ones and tend to be a little rough for its control of the main character, but it's still good. The games are not too difficult, and there are a lot of levels and challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Continuity 2: The Continuation</strong></p>

<p>Again a sequel to <a href="http://continuitygame.com/playcontinuity.html">a Flash game</a>, this platformer places you within a world where, when zoomed out, the world in broken up in sliding blocks. As such, you can walk from one sliding block to another only if the sides of the adjacent blocks match. Using pinch-to-zoom gestures, it is perfectly suited to the iPhone. The puzzles themselves aren't too difficult, but at times they will require you to <em>really</em> think outside of the box. Some of the timed challenges are too difficult, but aren't required to unlock anything other than an optional achievement.</p>

<p><strong>Red Remover</strong></p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/TheGameHomepage/red-remover">based Ina Flash game</a> (now you see why Apple finally allowed 3rd-party Flash-to-iOS conversion tools?), this one was free today, but is actually worth the full price. Your goal is to remove all the red boxes yet keep on screen all the green ones. The gravity mechanisms are simple yet combined in ingenious ways. There are a lot of levels, and they aren't too difficult. It's a great fun to play, and somehow even if I was totally blocked on a few levels I never became frustrated.</p>

<p>So, here you have them, 3 fun puzzle games you can "preview" with their Flash originals and buy if you want more levels on iOS. It's a good proposition...</p>
