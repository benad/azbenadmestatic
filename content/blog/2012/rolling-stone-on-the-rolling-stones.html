<p>I wanted to listen to some of the music by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> when I hit the same issue I was describing <a href="http://blog.benad.me/2012/3/24/the-need-for-djs.html">in March</a> (<em>Why do I so easily remember blog posts from 6 months ago?</em>). The Rolling Stones have produced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones_discography">29 studio albums</a> and countless singles and whatnot in the past 50 years, so no wonder I got lost in their discography. Of course I can pick up one of their many &#8220;best of&#8221; albums, but with that I&#8217;ll completely lose context.</p>

<p>Hence this useful guide of <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/rolling-stones-album-guide-the-good-the-great-and-the-angie-20120817">the best Rolling Stones albums</a> from Rolling Stone magazine by Rob Sheffield. Combined with my Rdio account, this is an amazing introduction, and I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m wasting my time too much. Also, a simple list may be more efficient than having to browse through countless posts in a forum about &#8220;What&#8217;s your favorite RS album?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now if only there was a something like that for other bands or genres I&#8217;ve never listened to&#8230;</p>
