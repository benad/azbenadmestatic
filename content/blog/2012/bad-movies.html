<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Apart from watching good movies from time to time, I sometimes watch <em>bad</em> movies on purpose. So, how do I discover particularly bad, yet enjoyable movies?</p>  <p>The first way to discover these is through the podcast <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/how-did-this-get-made/">How Did This Get Made</a>. If the movie they want to review is accessible enough (mostly through Netflix or iTunes rentals), then I watch it, and the I listen to their review. Often times their reviews are clearly more entertaining than the bad movie itself, and the rest of times their reviews are just as hilarious as the bad movies.</p>  <p>The second is through the other podcast called <a href="http://gmepodcast.com/">The Greatest Movie EVER! podcast</a>. In their case though the movies are less about being bad but more about being weird or quirky. Their movies tend to be quite difficult to acquire though, so I tend to just listen to their podcast.</p>  <p>The last is the Internet video show called <a href="http://redlettermedia.com/half-in-the-bag/">Half in the Bag</a>, essentially a movie review show with often scathing reviews. In this case the reviews are so amazing (for example the one for Jack and Jill) that I want to see the movie just to see the train wreck they described.</p></div>
