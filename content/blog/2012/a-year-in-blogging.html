<p>So, I ended this one year experiment of posting one blog post per day for a full year. <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2012/1/2/init-process.html">I started</a> with Posterous before it was acquired (and left for dead) by Twitter, before there was even a proper backup tool for it. I eventually moved to <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2012/4/14/my-blog-is-now-on-blogbenadme.html">blog.benad.me</a> and <a href="http://blog.benad.me/2012/7/19/another-blog-move.html">settled to Squarespace</a>, though quickly updating to version 6 <a href="http://blog.benad.me/c2c3ffc1-c0ba-4f65-97ba-7f1029839e5e">was a bad decision</a>. Over time, the iPad app for Squarespace was fixed faster than the iPhone version, so my routine settled to <a href="http://blog.benad.me/2012/3/16/trying-out-byword.html">Byword</a> and the Squarespace app to post.</p>

<p>Apart <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2012/1/25/effective-reminders-or-oops-i-already-broke-my-resolution.html">from a day</a>, I managed to do it. What I learned from it isn't as much about being disciplined, but instead how to keep enough spare time and mental energy to post something at least slightly insightful each day. In a way, from the process, I've learned how much mental energy I need to write "proper", be it after a hard day at work or while I'm sick (or both), which would partly explain the 2-4 paragraphs structure my posts now have.</p>

<p>Is my writing any better now than it was in 2011? Until I re-read myself, I can't say, and I'm not bothered to do so, since that wasn't the <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2012/7/1/what-was-the-point-of-posting-every-day-again.html">original intention</a> in the first place. But now I feel like I got a grasp of the tools and the challenges in writing anything more involved than a few (366) blog posts.</p>

<p>Some observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>I stopped tagging my posts a while ago, especially since that Squarespace 6 move. Maybe I should revise the posts and minimally tag them.</li>
<li>It seems like I managed to not (completely) repeat myself from one post to another, though maybe I did so only because I kept every single post short and to the point.</li>
<li>Squarespace isn't good blogging platform. I may yet again move the blog to some Wordpress on <a href="http://benad.me">my own site</a>, or maybe even some XSLT template with some Perl cruft to generate indices and tag clouds, since nothing beats read-only HTML for security.</li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> syntax is pretty well designed. Better than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup">Mediawiki's</a>, not as crazy as <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a>, and with the right apps can be quite convenient to write even on cellphones.</li>
<li>Even if I used the iPad as my main writing platform, nothing beats a full Mac to type a lot. Nothing beats it when copy-pasting links and multitasking. Sadly, it seems like computers are going in the direction of "content consumption platforms".</li>
</ul>

<p>So, this is it for now. I'll take a little break from that insane amount of blogging, and maybe focus on longer articles for my <a href="http://benad.me/">main site</a> under "<a href="http://benad.me/articles.xml">Articles</a>".</p>
