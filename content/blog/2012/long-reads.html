<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>A quick post, because I have a book to read. As I mentioned <a href="http://benad-blog.posterous.com/posterous-to-shut-down">yesterday</a>, I&rsquo;m reading <a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/25344/A-Clash-of-Kings">A Clash of Kings</a>, and it took me forever to read. I need to have more discipline or use a schedule, otherwise taking months to read a book makes you lose all form of pacing it could have. Maybe as an audio book it would be easier, but even then it doesn&rsquo;t work well for me for long reads since I read as fast at 2x audio narration, and unlike podcasts I don&rsquo;t like listening to audio books at 2x. I&rsquo;ll find a better reading methodology later.</p></div>
