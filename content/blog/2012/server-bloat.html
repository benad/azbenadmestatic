<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>My main annoyance with &ldquo;entreprise&rdquo; server operating systems is how much proprietary bloat they have. Up to now, I&rsquo;ve see it with Solaris 10, RedHat Enterprise Linux, IBM AIX and of course Windows Server. I understand that in the enterprise world there are a ton of requirements, which inevitably leads to feature bloat, but what irritates me is that each time there is bloat it is described with a proprietary terminology. I really, really don&rsquo;t think that those made-up product names and thingymabob infrastructure crap are even worth the learning curve.</p>  <p>As an example, I did learn quite a lot about Solaris administration. And I can now safely say that most of it was a waste of time <em>because</em> it was too Solaris-specific. Simple things that are somewhat standardized across Linux and even Mac are completely weird in Solaris (like a simple computer reboot), so it felt like they kept this legacy &ldquo;culture&rdquo; as an intellectual lock-in.</p>  <p>So, you want to be a sysadmin and not waste your memory on arcane proprietary crap that will be of no use whatsoever outside of your company? I&rsquo;d <strong>highly</strong> suggest <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a>, some Apache HTTPD and some Samba. Everything else seems like a waste of your brain cells in comparison.</p></div>
