<div class="posterous_autopost"><p>So, starting next Wednesday and for the week after, I&rsquo;ll be on vacation. And by vacation I mean not doing much except maybe finishing my taxes, if I don&rsquo;t finish that this weekend.</p>  <p>There&rsquo;s now a daily ritual of me barely waking up in the morning, feeling tired, being awake after lunch, being tired at 4PM, and being exhausted by 6PM when I leave work. But worse, since last Thursday or so, I get dizzy from time to time, at time having difficulty standing up. Though it has been better today, I may have to resort to a combination of sugar and caffeine, something I normally avoid because those beverages make me very &ldquo;gassy&rdquo; and are quite acidic.</p>  <p>And this has been my &ldquo;Achilles' Heel&rdquo; in my field: 8-9 hours of work per day is the maximum I can do consistently. If I work beyond that, well my productivity on the next day will be as if I worked less hours, so it averages out. Working overnight and the weekends &ldquo;the hacker&rsquo;s way&rdquo;? Nope, never could do that.</p>  <p>It&rsquo;s true that, as if to compensate, I can work at a shockingly fast speed. I can&rsquo;t boast that much about it since in the end other programmers end up working for longer hours, which objectively on a &ldquo;hours-worked&rdquo; mode of evaluation works against me. But it is comforting in a way to know that the quality of my work doesn&rsquo;t depend entirely on &ldquo;brute force programming&rdquo;, but more on creative, cleverly designed software engineering. And after that period of concentrated brilliance, my brain becomes some kind of half-melted jello, so in average it all balances out.</p>  <p>So, here goes two days of rush work, two days for the weekend to not fall sick, two last days of zombie-like confusion, and I can finally rest.</p></div>
