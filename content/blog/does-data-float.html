<p>Well, if any of your servers were on the east coast of the United States in the past few days, they might have been impacted by the massive storm that happened. Hopefully your data center didn&#8217;t get flooded with water. Most likely your servers ran out of electricity, understandable considering the pitiful state of the northeastern electrical grid.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s just so easy to underestimate how in the end &#8220;the cloud&#8221; is actually in some physical location. While you can search for some safe isolated place for a data center, putting everything in one place is still a pretty big risk. That is the whole point of the Internet infrastructure anyway, since creating multi-site redundancy is relatively easy. Data coming from one location is the same as data coming from another.</p>
