<p><a href="http://www.osgi.org/">OSGi</a> is much easier than it seems, and <a href="http://www.springsource.org/osgi">Spring Dynamic Modules</a> reduces the amount of code needed to wire services together.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> already supports OSGi modules, but work on a branch of <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> to make it support OSGi is being done under the name <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGiAndNetBeans">Netigso</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CXF/Distributed+OSGi">Distributed OSGi</a> looks interesting, especially since I dislike J2EE bean patterns in general.</p>
