<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>A quick post today. Yesterday I bought on Kindle what was a long article from <a href="http://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a> called &ldquo;Research No Motion&rdquo;, talking about RIM&rsquo;s difficulties in the current cellphone market. It was pretty cheap ($1), but it&rsquo;s quite convenient to read long articles without any ads and with Kindle&rsquo;s auto-bookmarking and synchronization. Of course I could go through the trouble of copy-pasting the text and converting it into a Kindle document, but at least I&rsquo;m supporting the web site.</p>  <p>I don&rsquo;t see any problem with web sites that export some of their best article in electronic book form, as long as the price is reasonable. Of course right now everybody expect web sites to be always free, but I prefer paying for convenience rather than paying for access to an article &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; behind a pay wall. Hopefully this could become a popular way to support web sites.</p></div>
