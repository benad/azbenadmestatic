<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>As you may have noticed in my <a href="http://benad-blog.posterous.com/taking-note-of-note-taking">previous</a> <a href="http://benad-blog.posterous.com/trying-out-byword">posts</a>, I&rsquo;ve been looking for a while for the &ldquo;best&rdquo; iOS text editor (well, at least best for my posts to this blog).</p>  <p>Well, it so just happened that <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> compiled a list of all the text editors for iOS with the name <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/">iTextEditors</a>. And it&rsquo;s a huge list.</p>  <p>For now, I think I&rsquo;m satisfied with Nebulous and Byword, as both a quite optimized for markdown, both for editing and rendering output options, but if they start annoying me too much I&rsquo;ll go though Terpstra&rsquo;s list for sure.</p></div>
