<p>Small update to yesterday's post.</p>
<p>My laptop came back, but the serial number in the logic boad was blank. No serial number means many registered software will refuse to re-register (as if the changed MAC address on the network card wasn't enough).</p>
<p>I sent it back, with a note reminding that re-flashing the serial number is <i>required</i> by Apple since April 2007.</p>
