<p>When defining log levels, I always hit a limit in my inspiration. There's "debug" and "trace" levels on one end, and there's "info", "warn" and "error" at the other end. But what errors that are more than just recoverable errors?</p>

<p>The term "critical" seems fine, but not enough over the top. "Fatal" is too expedient. "Unexpected" is too common (and expected).</p>

<p>I still haven't found anything that beats "flagrant", as in "<a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/virus">flagrant system error</a>". That, and the sound of a car crash the PowerMacs used to play when there was a firmware crash.</p>
