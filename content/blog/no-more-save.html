<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>This week I had to remind somebody at work to save their file (using a tool I maintained years ago) from time to time. That&rsquo;s something that always annoyed me: Explaining to others that unless you save your document from time to time, if the computer or software crashed, your changes will be gone. It annoys me because I know full well that it isn&rsquo;t intuitive. Even file management isn&rsquo;t intuitive either.</p>  <p>I can understand why in the past few years Apple has been phasing out the &ldquo;Save&rdquo; command from their software. Even on OS X, their own software simply auto-saves revisions automatically (essentially checkpoints of the undo buffer). Right now I&rsquo;m using Mail and Gmail just because they auto-save drafts.</p>  <p>The POSIX-like core will always remain, but I greatly see the benefits of shielding users from this over-abused file system metaphor, with it&rsquo;s folders and desktop. Give the UNIX shell for professionals, and stop pestering the rest with that control-s habit.</p></div>
