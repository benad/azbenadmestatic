<p>I always found office parties to be awkward. Well, anything social is awkward for me, but office parties a bit more. Formal Christmas parties even more. But then, it surely just be me. A lot of people like to dress up for events, and pretty much enjoy constructed and slightly forced social settings.</p>

<p>Sure, others may not like office parties because of the bad food or because they may not like at all their coworkers in the first place. For me though, this isn't the case. It's just that the setting isn't enjoyable. The darkness, the noise and the bad music seem antithetical to, well, just talking to other people. I also find odd to eat at the candlelight if the focus was the food or the people sitting around you. And dancing after your stomach is full of food and alcohol always felt like a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>But all of that isn't why I left today's Christmas party so early. I really wish I would have stayed, but I'm half sick with a very weak stomach, and I barely slept two days in a row. The food must have been nice, I have great coworkers, the setting (not considering the tropes of parties I mentioned above) was relaxed. Still, on a Thursday? I have to rest and recover as much as possible for tomorrow's work day.</p>
