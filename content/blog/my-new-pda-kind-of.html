<p>So... I got a <a href="http://www.nokia.ca/A4688231">Nokia N810</a> "Internet Tablet". It's about twice the weight of a "smartphone", twice the size of a cellphone... And it's not a cellphone.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, traditional PDAs were gradually replaced by smartphones targeted to business. But then, for years I wanted a super-portable computer, not a cellphone attached to a ridiculous data plan (well, at least here in Canada).</p>

<p>So I bought a N810, <a href="http://www.nokia.ca/A4688234">Linux-based</a> (oh, the joys of hacking the sh*t out of it, in full legality), fast, easy to use and with an amazing screen. Oh, and it can also <a href="http://www.access-company.com/products/gvm/">emulate a Palm</a>, turning it into a traditional PDA...</p>

<p>Actually, I mostly going to use its GPS and offline map capabilities in my travels. That way, I don't have to bring my laptop through the customs every time, and I have everything I need computer-wise.</p>

<p>OK, I wrote this post long enough on its small keyboard... (This posting was entirely made on my N810, and it was quite pleasant!)</p>
