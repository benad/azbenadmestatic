<p><div class='posterous_autopost'>This afternoon I was preparing the CSS of my new blog location when I notice how better web design tools are now compared to ten years ago. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/">Firebug</a>, the extension for Firefox has always been a leader, though I often used external software for CSS editing. With <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> came a powerful set of built-in tools that can inspect any page element and show how and <em>why</em> it was styled a certain way. <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> copied that also (since it inherited from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a>, the engine of Safari).  Today I combined both <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso 2</a> from <a href="http://macrabbit.com/">MacRabbit</a>,  powerful HTML and CSS with live preview and Firefox + Firebug, both that I haven&rsquo;t used in a while. Wow. This was so much easier than plain-text editors with the CSS spec open&hellip; Maybe it&rsquo;s time to revamp my web site&rsquo;s (anemic) style&hellip;</div></p>
