<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>At times, I drool over some new &ldquo;indie&rdquo; games available to download (at a reasonable price) on Xbox 360, for example <a href="http://polytroncorporation.com/fez">Fez</a> and <a href="http://www.runner2.com/">Bit.Trip Runner 2</a>. But then I don&rsquo;t have an Xbox.</p>  <p>So here&rsquo;s the problem. Xbox starts at $200, and with a decent hard drive at $250 (but that&rsquo;s a special price, since normally that would be $300). Add also $60 a year for Xbox Live Gold, or whatever that means. It gets worse. I would have to essentially &ldquo;maintain&rdquo; this new mini-computer. I&rsquo;m already annoyed by the regular software updates to my Samsung Blu-Ray player, so imagine how annoyed I would be with Xbox&rsquo;s ones.</p>  <p>I&rsquo;m starting to understand why games on the iPhone are getting so popular. Maintenance of an iPhone is easy, and I already own one. I don&rsquo;t have this $300+ barrier to entry to even <em>start</em> playing games, and what I already have is functional for other things than games. Yes, I know, you can use the Xbox as a media center of sorts, but I already have my Mac Mini for that.</p>  <p>So, I guess I&rsquo;ll be skipping a lot of good games because I don&rsquo;t want to bother with video game consoles anymore. Instead, I&rsquo;ll reduce my queues of movies to see and books to read, and I think that&rsquo;s for the best.</p></div>
