<p>A quick post about web development, especially across browsers and OS. There are to sets of tools that can save you a lot of headaches when doing CSS development.</p>
<p>The first one is the CSS tools from <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo! UI Library</a>, namely <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/">Reset CSS</a> to reset base CSS style differences across browser, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/base/">Base CSS</a> to then restore every styles to sensible defaults, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/">Fonts CSS</a> to have base fonts that don't suck (with a cheat sheet for font size and family adjustment that works even with font zooming), and finally <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">Grids CSS</a> for basic grid layouts that "just work" and don't break.</p>
<p>And as a quick note, as part of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> they have released the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/">YUI Compressor</a>, a Java command-line tool that has both a JavaScript compressor/obsfucator and a CSS compressor (open source, BSD-style).</p>
<p>The second one is weirder. It's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/">ie7-js</a>, a set of JavaScripts that makes Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 and higher behave more standard-compliant, fixing semi-transparent PNGs in IE 5.5 and IE 6 along the way. It works pretty well (for "beta" JavaScript hacks), and it's a ton better than always having to tweak your code with workarounds for only IE.</p>
