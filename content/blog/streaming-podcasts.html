<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2010/2/23/passive-entertainment.html">over two years ago</a>, I do watch a lot of video podcasts. But one things annoys me though: The sheer size of the downloads. Having an Internet connection with a metered bandwidth means that each download is an investment, meaning if you automatically downloaded an episode you want to skip, you've just wasted up to half a Gigabyte of bandwidth.</p>

<p>Something I noticed with <a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/">Downcast</a> on the iPad is that you can easily subscribe to a video podcast without activating automatic download, but still tracking watched episodes akin to a more traditional RSS reader. Combined with AirPlay, it becomes quite a reasonable interface to watch videos.</p>

<p>The only question that remains is: Should I subscribe to YouTube channels through an RSS reader too, instead of YouTube's own channel subscription system? I think that would be the best system...</p>
