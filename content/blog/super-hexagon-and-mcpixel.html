<p>Two new "indie" iOS games (iPod, iPad and iPhone) released in the past weeks that I would highly recommend.</p>

<p>First, a new game by the maker of <a href="http://blog.benad.me/2012/9/3/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a>: <a href="http://superhexagon.com/">Super Hexagon</a>. You're a small triangle at the center of the screen, and you have to rotate to avoid walls coming at you. You can hit walls sideways, but if a wall hits you in front the game ends. Sounds simple, but trust me, the game is difficult. The game starts with the difficulty levels "hard", "harder" and "hardest", and has an amazing soundtrack by <a href="http://chipzelmusic.bandcamp.com/">chipzel</a> that will make you come back. You can try its precursor <a href="http://distractionware.com/blog/2012/02/hexagon/">Hexagon</a> online, but I warn you that Super Hexagon has new patterns and surprises. If you're in for a real gaming challenge, Super Hexagon is for you.</p>

<p><a href="http://mcpixel.net/">McPixel</a> is an old-school point-and-click adventure parody of Saturday Night Live's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGruber">MacGruber</a>. Essentially, you have 20 seconds to diffuse a bomb, and if you make a mistake, it explodes. The humor seems juvenile, yet has an amazing level of awkward absurdity top make even the random explosions quite funny. There are a ton of levels, plus extra levels that unlock when you find all the possible endings of other levels, and insane bonus levels when you diffuse 3 bombs in a row without mistake. It's a really fun game that rewards exploration with a joke each time.</p>
