<p>The official <a href="http://www.readability.com/">Readability</a> app is pretty good, but for some reason it annoys me. The custom fonts aren&#8217;t as great as they&#8217;re sold to be, and archiving articles when offline breaks the sync. Still, I found it a pretty good alternate service to <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, which remains my main &#8220;read later&#8221; service.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised that <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> actually is a full Readability client. The sync works great, offline or not. It fits really well with my RSS reading habits. And, oddly enough, it feels quite convenient to mark RSS articles to Readability within the app, and see them right away in the Readability section within the same app. In a way, it feels like <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>&#8217;s starring, but with proper archiving (meaning you can see all articles you previously marked in the past).</p>

<p>Reeder also supports <a href="http://feedafever.com/">Fever</a>, a very odd commercial PHP package that leaves hosting up to you. If they offered VM images <em>Ã  la</em> <a href="https://hub.turnkeylinux.org/">TurnKey Hub</a>, I wouldn&#8217;t mind paying the $30 license on top of the $60 / year Amazon EC3 hosting, but until then I really don&#8217;t see the point of this.</p>
