<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>On some days I&rsquo;m <em>way</em> too tired to be looking at a screen. So I want to play some podcasts on my iPhone, so I end up looking at another bright screen. Is there a way to fully use the iPhone with the screen off.</p>  <p>Actually, there is. I use the iPhone&rsquo;s accessibility mode called &ldquo;VoiceOver&rdquo;, which is made for blind or visually impaired users. At first, it&rsquo;s strange to use, since a single tap doesn&rsquo;t actually press buttons on screen; rather, it selects an element and <em>speaks</em> its description, and then you use double-tap to press on it. Since moving the finger on screen only continuously selects elements, you have to use triple-finger swipe to swipe the screen.</p>  <p>Sliding the finger left and right as a gesture will select the &ldquo;next&rdquo; and &ldquo;previous&rdquo; elements, while single finger up and down is a customized action, normally playing the next or previous word, but could be anything else. Double-finger swipe down start playing back the current element, useful to play back an entire web page.</p>  <p>I could keep on going, but the point is that you have to read the VoiceOver section of the <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iphone_user_guide.pdf">iPhone manual</a> and practice a bit, otherwise you&rsquo;ll get completely lost. For me, I remembered enough of it that it works quite well for me, even if it&rsquo;s just to relax my eyes. Now, if only developers placed better button labels, especially when I use French as the text to speech language&hellip;</p></div>
