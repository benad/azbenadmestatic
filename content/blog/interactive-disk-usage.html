<p>A quick post about a great interactive version of the <code>du</code> command. It's called "<a href="http://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu">NCurses Disk Usage</a>" (<code>ncdu</code>), and works directly on the console by using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html">ncurses</a>. In the past, I used to collected disk usage data from GUI-less servers using <code>du</code> then transferring the file back to a GUI-enabled machine and display it using either <a href="http://xdiskusage.sourceforge.net/">xdiskusage</a> or <a href="http://kdirstat.sourceforge.net/">KDirStat</a>. Cumbersome to say the least.</p>

<p>Nice touches of <code>ncdu</code> includes its great portability, and the fact that its web site has the most comprehensive list of graphical <code>du</code> replacements I've seen.</p>
