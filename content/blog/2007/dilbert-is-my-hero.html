<p>I know, the Dilbert comic became a kind of <i>clich√©</i> of itself, but today's strip can summarize years of my work. Yet, unlike me, Dilbert actually has the <i>balls</i> to not be walked over like a rug.</p>
<p><b>Some Guy</b>: Dilbert, do you have some time to help me with this technical analysis?<br/>
<b>Dilbert</b>: Sure, if you'll go to my house and mow my lawn so this doesn't become a lopsided relationship.<br/>
<b>Some Guy</b>: Why must you be so difficult to abuse?<br/>
<b>Dilbert</b>: Go spit in your socks.</p>
