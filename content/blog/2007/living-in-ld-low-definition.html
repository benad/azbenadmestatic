<p>As the fall TV season started, I noticed I had little time to actually watch at home the few shows I like. So, I bought an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodclassic/">iPod Classic</a> to both time-shift and location-shift my TV viewing habits.</p>
<p>First, to get the shows, well... I found online downloads quite convenient, especially considering the ultimate destination of the video files would be my iPod. Since I'm in Canada, and thanks to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Radio-television_and_Telecommunications_Commission">CRTC</a> and some good lobbying, I can't buy them legally on <i>any</i> online service, I resort to BitTorrent downloads. Sites like <a href="http://eztvefnet.org/">EZTV</a> and <a href="http://tvrss.net/">tvRSS</a> are surprisingly good, making piracy even easier than buying the real thing. Once I get the files, I either use <a href="http://www.isquint.org/">iSquint</a> or the combo of <a href="http://www.perian.org/">Perian</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro/">QuickTime Pro</a>.</p>
<p>As for the shows I already bought as DVD sets, I use the cross-platform tool <a href="http://handbrake.m0k.org/">HandBrake</a>. This also works on shows recorded on a DVD recorder, which is useful when I watch local shows in Qu√©bec that aren't quite popular enough to be on BitTorrent.</p>
<p>So... How is it on a 320x240 screen? Actually quite good. The trick is to encode to those specific dimensions if you don't plan to watch the video on your screen. It seems the downscaler built-in the iPod is not strong on the interpolation, making the edges quite blocky if you play a 640x480 video file. And encoding it as a "bonsai movie" makes the video file smaller (not like I'm missing space on the 80GB drive, yet).</p>
<p>I was actually planning to talk about stuff like higher-level programing languages, continuations, micro-threading and copy-on-write object design, but I'm lazy. I'll go back on watching a video on my 2.5-inch screen...</p>
