<p>OK, I'm fighting a slight headache to come up with an excuse as to why I haven't updated this journal in a long while, and I can't.</p>
<p>True, my interest in software development is the same, floating the D programing language, integrating Groovy and the Spring Framework, thinking of a way a web framework could support fully cacheable pages for certain sections of the site while still keeping dynamism, to the more philosophical implications of Software Design (versus Architecture) to what I consider to be the "ethics software conception". But I digress.</p>
<p>I badly need to use the next few days to prepare for a trip to New York I'm taking with a friend. I always knew that maturity has to be learned, and this 3rd trip to the United States will give me that occasion.</p>
<p>If you act like a detective like me, you know already of my sudden interest in Usenet (the NNTP protocol), as a replacement of BitTorrent and the over-protective Mac version of PeerGuardian. And having been a new user of Facebook for a couple of days, I don't see what's the big deal about it. A more user-friendly version of a closed BBS? I guess...</p>
<p>Enough for today. Thanks for spying!</p>
