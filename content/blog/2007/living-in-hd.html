<p>As you can guess, I've been quite busy in the past few months. And there's a reason: my new MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>At first glance, it looks the same as my 3-year-old 1.5GHz PowerBook. But there are two things that makes it stand out.</p>
<p>First, a full 1080p HD screen. That is, my screen is a whopping 1920x1200 pixels, compared to 1440x900 before. That almost twice the amount of pixels as I had before, and is the equivalent of a 23" flat screen on a 17" laptop.</p>
<p>Well, apart from squinting more at my screen and watching <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">1080p previews</a>, why would I need such a big screen, especially on a laptop? Well, because I can?</p>
<p>Actually, with software development, more text on screen is always better, regardless of the size. There's nothing more satisfying than having a terminal screen following log files at 300 columns of text and 80 rows.</p>
<p>Also, I started using Macs on a 512x342 black and white screen, where every pixel would count. To give you an idea, this is <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Sys6screenshotbusy.png">where I started</a>, and this is <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/benad/screenshot_macbookpro.png">where I am now</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's an Intel chip. A "Core 2 Duo" at 2.4GHz, or whatever that is. Coupled with an amazing 800MHz motherboard, running Windows XP Pro with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">Boot Camp</a> inside <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMware Fusion</a> is smooth. If you don't know what I'm talking about, let me summarize: you run Windows at the same time as your Mac or after a reboot, you choose, and both options are fast (no emulation).</p>
<p>Yes, I'm running both Mac OS X and Windows XP at the same time. I still have a hard time adapting to this "fusion"...</p>
