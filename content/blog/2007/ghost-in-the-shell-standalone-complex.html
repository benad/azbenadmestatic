<p>So, I was finally able to complete watching the "Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex" TV series, season 1 and 2. It wasn't without problems though. The Season 1 box had one of its DVD in DTS, not Dolby, so it was playable on my PowerBook only in <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>. And Season 2 had no "season box", so it was almost twice the price of Season 1, and even then the 5th DVD case was badly damaged.</p>

<p>But it was worth it. This being the 2nd time I watched the series (hint), I was amazed by the artistic depth of every episode, especially in the 2nd season. I'm used to the quality standards of "western" animated series, but this blew me away. I suspect the 2nd series alone might have cost in the region of $10M.</p>

<p>Still, by the end of watching it, I felt a little bit like Motoko ("Major"), exhausted by the drama and darkness of the show. That, and no matter how many praises I could write about it, I'm due to a change of the style of TV shows and music I watch and listen to. I'll listen a bit to the Global Underground collection I have and try to move on I guess.</p>

<p>Oh, if only Futurama could come back faster!</p>
