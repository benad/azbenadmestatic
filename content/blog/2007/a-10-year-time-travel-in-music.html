<p>Well, today I'm starting a 10-year time travel in electronic music, following the variations in the well-known <a href="http://www.globalunderground.co.uk/">Global Underground</a> series, using their <a href="http://www.recordstore.co.uk/global/productdetail.jsp?productPK=unittest-KEh3nV33Xwpj5KtiqN3IEb-13">music compilation</a>.</p>
<p>In a sense, I agree with Dave Seaman's article "<a href="http://www.djdaveseaman.com/news.htm">One man's trance is another man's techno</a>", that trying to "intellectualize" the electronic music genres is futile and pointless. As much as I tried to figure it out myself, I couldn't do it, since as soon as I would have an hypothesis, some DJ would come along and mess up the picture. So <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/benad/electronic_music_styles.png">this diagram</a> of mine should be put in my mental "wall of shame" of my horrible intellectual failures (and waste of time).</p>
<p>OK, I'm still listening to GU001: Tel Aviv from Tony De Vit, and it's already strange to my ears, compared to GU029 by Sharam. And there's still 19 albums after that. At least I can listen to them while doing other things...</p>
