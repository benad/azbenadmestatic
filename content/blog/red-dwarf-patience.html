<p>For some TV shows that can't be bought online in Canada or seen on conventional TV (without paying an arm and a leg for speciality channels), I end up, well, finding other means to watch the show. But for the 10th season of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dwarf">Red Dwarf</a>, I'll patiently wait for the DVD release. Here's why.</p>

<p>As odd as it sounds, Red Dwarf ought to have been cancelled <em>thirteen</em> years ago when its eight season finished. That sounds like a lot, until you realize that those "seasons" are six episodes each. Still, the series could have just ended, and it would have been fine. The actors moved on to other (great) things, the writers too, so all was fine. But as some kind of "let's try this out", a three-episode season 9 was presented on TV, and was popular enough to make the tenth season possible.</p>

<p>Having seen with season 9 that the writers and actors were just as good as before, and given that the reviews seem to be quite positive, I'll trust them and wait to buy it on DVD. There are few comedy and science-fiction hybrid shows on TV, and for me this series is worth the expense. So, just two more months...</p>
