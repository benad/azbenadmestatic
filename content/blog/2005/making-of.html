<p>
When "re-creating" this blog, I wanted to change the "style" I was using to something that looked better. Only problem was that I wanted to add a web counter (from <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">Statcounter</a>) on the page. I ended up learning the Perl-like programming language of the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/doc/s2/">S2</a> style system, and created a new style of my own with a new "user layer" overwriting some function in the code generating the sidebar. Overkill? Yes, but very cool once you learn how it works. The coolest thing is that this super-flexible system of generating pages in LiveJournal is <a href="http://www.livejournal.org/">open source</a> and in Perl.
<p/>
I also looked for a Mac editor, but I decided to simply not bother. The web interface is "good enough", and since the preview is in my Firefox browser I can use the excellent <a href="http://www.kevinfreitas.net/extensions/linkchecker/">LinkChecker</a> extension to check for typos in my external links in my post.
<p/>
I still have to find an automated way to automate backups and to use 24-hour format for the timestamps, but I'll do that later.
<p/>
<i>UPDATE</i>
<p/>
Already changed the layer to use 24-hour format. That was too easy...
