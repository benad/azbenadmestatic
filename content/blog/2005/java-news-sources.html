How do I manage to know what's the latest buzz in Java development?
<p/>
First, I subscribe to the RSS feed at http://del.icio.us/tag/java . There's a lot of noise, but I myself post my bookmarks on del.icio.us, especially interesting Java ones, so there's a lot of good things there.
<p/>
I also look at http://www.java-source.net/last-projects . There's no RSS feed there, but it's quite good and worth frequent visits.
<p/>
Finally, I listen to podcast <a href="http://javacast.thepostmodern.net/">JavaCast</a>. It's usually way too long (it's now 2 hours per episode!), but is absolutely great.
<p/>
So, in summary:
<ul><li>http://del.icio.us/tag/java</li>
<li>http://www.java-source.net/last-projects</li>
<li><a href="http://javacast.thepostmodern.net/">JavaCast</a></li>
</ul>
