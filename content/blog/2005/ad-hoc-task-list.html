<p>Here's a very useful (and cool) trick I made up a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>When you're working on a project or something, you often have to maintain a "To Do" list. There are some good programs to do this, for example <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a>, but then to view it you'll need some software. Or you can use some web-based application, but then you'd be "locked in" that application.</p>

<p>So, a plain text file is the way to go...</p>

<p>As a convention, you can keep the highest priority tasks on top and the completed one on the bottom. If you are using a fixed-width font to view the text file, you also have more liberty to add "column" for due dates and such:</p>

<pre>- 20050917 12: Finish backup system
- 20050931 01: Deployment tests
- xxxxxxxx 17: Take a break</pre>

<p>This is nice, but what about the <i>status</i> of those tasks? Here's the trick I came up with:</p>

<pre>LEGEND:
  -: todo
  &gt;: postponed
  &lt;: late
  ~: started
  #: almost done (testing needed)
  x: done
  *: continuous development ("sticky task")
  @: cancelled (or postponed for a long time)]]></pre>

<p>As you can see, it's pretty intuitive. Here's an example:</p>

<pre># Write schema
- Update DB access
* JavaDoc
&lt; Update specs
- Add logging
&gt; Add admin backed
@ Add reporting tool  &lt;---- Not really needed
x First draft of specs
x First draft of design doc</pre>

<p>Useful, no? And doesn't cost a thing!</p>
