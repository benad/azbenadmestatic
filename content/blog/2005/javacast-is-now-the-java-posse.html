<p>A quick note about the JavaCast podcast I mentioned <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/benad/1098.html">earlier</a>. It now moved to <a href="http://javaposse.com/">The Java Posse</a>, with a better format, and more "digestible" lengths per episode.</p>

<p>Some of the links on their web site are quite interesting, for example the <a href="http://getahead.ltd.uk/doctree/">Big JavaDoc index</a> and many, many reading recommendations for Java beginners.</p>
