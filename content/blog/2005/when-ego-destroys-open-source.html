<p>A quick post...</p>

<p>I always had some doubts concerning <a href="http://www.jboss.com/">JBoss</a>' (the corporation) agressivity against other open-source projects , especially the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">spring framework</a>. But <a href="http://www.cbronline.com/article_news.asp?guid=956731CE-1447-4C3B-A840-9B9770F6FDF8">doing a partnership with Microsoft</a> to compete against IBM for the server space? Make <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> work better with MSSQL? Better integrate Java and .Net?</p>

<p>Oh, and <a href="http://thejbossissue.blogspot.com/">suing the heck out</a> of everyone using the word "JBoss", especially since JBoss Inc. want to <a href="http://news.com.com/JBoss+denies+running+a+trademark+monopoly/2100-7344_3-5893015.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5893015&amp;subj=news">keep a monopoly</a> of offering JBoss related services?</p>

<p>Hmmm... So sad to see good open-source projects cought up in a few people's ambition and ego...</p>

<p><i>Note to self: don't be like that, no matter what happens.</i></p>
