<p>Something interesting about version control:</p>

<p><i>Cool article on OnLamp about a guy who uses subversion for everything in his home directory. He has a public section accessible from the Internet.</i></p>

<p><i>Using subversion, he's able to have a history of his homedir as well as automated backups, so if he loses something he just rolls back.</i></p>
