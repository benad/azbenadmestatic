<p>Here's a quick entry about two tools I found about the coding style you use when writing Java code.</p>

<p>First, if you're code syntax is getting messy, or you're stuck having to maintain code from someone with complete lack of coding style, you can use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jalopy/">Jalopy</a>. It has tons of options and the latest beta supports Java 1.5 syntax too! Look for the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> plugin at <a href="http://contrib.netbeans.org/">http://contrib.netbeans.org/</a> if you want to use it with a GUI.</p>

<p>Second, if you want to verify that some Java code adheres to some syntax, including the way variables, classes and functions are named, you can use <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a>. This can be important if your library's external interface shouldn't look like a mess...</p>
