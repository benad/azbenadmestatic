<ul>
<li><b>Finish my web site</b>: <a href="http://benad.me/">http://benad.me/</a>. Yeah, I'm too slow.</li>
<li><b>Start using a new programming language</b>. I'm thinking of <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>, a pretty nice scripting language for Java. Somehow, I was never able to use it much. That, and languages like Python and Haskell simply feel horrible to me.</li>
<li><b>Contribute to an open-source software project</b>. <i>Not</i> making a new project.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's all I can think of for now.</p>
