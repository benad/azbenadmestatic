<p>The plainly named "<a href="http://junecloud.com/software/iphone/delivery-status-touch.html">Delivery Status touch</a>, and app for iOS, has been my app of choice to track my deliveries for years. You put your tracker number (FedEx, UPS, USPS, Canada Post, etc.), and it displays its tracking status in an interface far more convenient than a full web site. It can even track packages directly from Apple’s store or from Amazon.</p><p>They have their own sync service so that its syncs your packages across devices, or you can track the packages on their <a href="https://junecloud.com/sync/">web interface</a>. The only minor gripe that I have is that to get push notification you need to use the free Mac OS X <a href="http://junecloud.com/software/mac/delivery-status.html">widget</a>. I wouldn’t mind paying for an in-app purchase to get notifications. Otherwise, if you order things online, I highly recommend this app.</p>
