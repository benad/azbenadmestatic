<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I was about to write a long review about the Bit.Trip game series, when I simultaneously felt tired and noticed how little games I played in the past few months.</p>  <p>Yes, I played a few &ldquo;casual&rdquo; games from time to time, but rarely more than a few minutes at a time. The game Infinity Blade is the first time in months I played more than 10 minutes in a row.</p>  <p>After all, games take considerable amounts of mental energy, at least the kind of games I play. Now that it&rsquo;s spring I&rsquo;m less exhausted all the time, but still even compared to 10 years ago I just end up being tired, either due to lack of sleep or being half-sick or working too much.</p>  <p>So don&rsquo;t ask why I would &ldquo;waste&rdquo; my vacation days playing games. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;escapism&rdquo;, but more catching up on all the games I wanted to play.</p></div>
