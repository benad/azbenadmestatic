<p>On a whim, a played a bit with the game <a href="http://www.gog.com/gamecard/duke_nukem_3d_atomic_edition">Duke Nukem 3D</a> today. And while I somehow still remember many things, I got stuck again at the same level and I needed some assistance. So, I turned to <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/197174-duke-nukem-3d/faqs">GameFAQs</a>, a site that contains many game walk through and hint guides, usually in large plain text files.</p>

<p>Nowadays, video walkthroughs on YouTube or elsewhere are getting quite popular. The problem though with these is that sometimes you just need a quick hint, and not having to fast-forward through hours of video.</p>

<p>What is surprising about those FAQs is that they're maybe one of the last remnants of the old BBS days, where plain text documents was <em>the</em> unit of communication. The format has a great efficiency, is extremely portable, is easy to search through, and doesn't even bother with copy protection.</p>

<p>Oh, and by the way, for the first time I configured the controls of Nukem to be more "modern", meaning mouse to aim, keyboard to walk forward or sideways. The results were spectacular: For the first time I was able to finish act 1 at normal difficulty. This pales in comparison to my brother beating the game <a href="http://www.ftlgame.com/">FTL</a>, but still, not bad for somebody that haven't playing first-person shooters in a long while.</p>
