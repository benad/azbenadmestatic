---

This is a short post to mention that my blog, originally hosted on
[Squarespace](http://squarespace.com/) as [blog.benad.me](http://blog.benad.me/)
has now moved alongside my [main web site](http://benad.me/) under
[benad.me/blog](http://benad.me/blog/).

All links to each post and the [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/benad)
should now automatically redirect to the new location. This may have created some
duplicates in your feed reader.

There is still some clean up to do to make the older posts look better, and I need to post
a longer article to explain the rationale behind this, but for now everything
should be working fine. The [blog.benad.me](http://blog.benad.me/) domain will remain active as
an option if something were to happen, but for the time being my blog should remain where
it is.
