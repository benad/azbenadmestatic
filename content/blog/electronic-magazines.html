<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I have a weakness for magazines in electronic form. A long time ago I used to buy the British magazine MacFormat since it came with a CD which compensated for my lack of Internet access, and on it there was a self-contained application that displayed a free, community-built magazine. While I couldn&rsquo;t compare back then, I still find the <em>designed</em> nature of page-based magazines more pleasing to the eye and less &ldquo;information overload&rdquo; than most web sites. As a modern-day example, I find Engadget&rsquo;s free iPad magazine <a href="http://www.engadget.com/downloads/distro">Distro</a> far easier to read than the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> web site. Even worse is <a href="www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>, which is so heavy that I need to use <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">Opera Mini</a> on my iPad to read it.</p>  <p>And now with tablets, electronic magazines shine. They are perfect of &ldquo;casual reading&rdquo;, they look amazing on those color screens, and since they&rsquo;re all in electronic form they are less annoying than paper magazines that you need to store and recycle. In fact, I prefer reading books on e-ink readers (like the traditional Kindle) and magazines on a tablet (like the iPad).</p>  <p>There are many apps for magazines that contain in-app subscriptions, such as <a href="http://www.economist.com/digital">The Economist</a> and <a href="www.projectmag.com/">Project</a>. For one-to-one transfers of magazines to pseudo-PDF you can use <a href="http://www.zinio.com/">Zinio</a>, which includes a plain-text version of each article for easier reading on an iPhone. All of these are at prices that compete with physical magazines, and for some you may even save money.</p></div>
