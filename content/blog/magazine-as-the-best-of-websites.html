<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>The free magazine <a href="http://www.theredditor.com/">The Redditor</a> is a great example of magazines built up from the contents of a web site, in this case <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>. Like Distro for Engadget, but most importantly Macworld, PC Mag and many others, magazines ends up still existing in digital form, with great layout and typography, and at the same time still serves a purpose to summarize the deluge of daily contents from a web site, plus a few long articles as exclusives.</p>  <p>So, magazines are not dead, but need web sites to build on. That works for me.</p>  <p><em>(I should find a way to write my posts throughout the day, otherwise at the end of the day I get to tired to even form sentences correctly&hellip;)</em></p></div>
