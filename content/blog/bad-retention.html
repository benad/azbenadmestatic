<p><em>Ugh</em>. I wasted too much time this evening figuring out how I will be able to replace my "limited time offer" 6GB for $30 data plan with <a href="http://www.rogers.com/">Rogers</a>. If my math is correct, my plan goes down to 500MB per month at $45 to have the "privilege" of retaining tethering, but the data plan can be used in the USA and if I go over my limit it goes to 1GB at $60 automatically. Playing with the options I end up paying $5 more per month for the "privilege" of not having a contract. I don't understand why their LTE-only plans are far better at the same price.</p>

<p>Meh. For some reason, with <a href="http://fido.ca/">Fido</a>, which is owned by the same company, <a href="http://www.fido.ca/web/content/internet/wia_email_options">the data plan</a> <em>without contract</em> is actually better at 2GB for $25 compared to 500MB for $25 <em>with</em> a ridiculous 3-year contract. Of course, both options include tethering. I double-checked and this is correct. I don't get it. Do they prevent iPhone users to get that data plan by making visual voicemail accessible only through a <a href="http://www.fido.ca/web/content/monthly/iphoneplans">3-year iPhone plan</a>? What's the catch?</p>

<p>Oh, and of course Rogers' retention offers are horrendous. $50 off a Galaxy S2 LTE or Razr XT910? Is that a way to treat a 4-year customer that payed through his nose?</p>

<p>I have less than a month now to figure it out. Should I pester a retentions guy to give me a better price for data plans, or switch to Fido and see what happens? I might even ditch them and go to <a href="http://www.telusmobility.com/">Telus</a>, because right now <em>anything</em> seem better than Rogers' abysimal plans.</p>
