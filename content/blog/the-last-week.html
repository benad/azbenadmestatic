<p>If you're gullible, or crazy, you'd think that this is the last week, since the end of the world (whatever that means) was predicted by some primitive Mayan astrologists to be on December 21st, or whenever the numbers run out, because the world should end if dates don't fit in their calendar.</p>

<p>That encouraged be to listen to the audiobook form of Hodgman's book "That Is All", as it goes into great length predicting, day by day, then events that would lead to the end of the world.</p>

<p>I rarely both read a book (more so, in physical form) and listen to it in audio form afterwards, but Hodgman's performance gives the text new life. In a way, it is closer to a radio play than a simple read through of a book.</p>

<p>If I dared add up the audio book's page count to the other books, I still far short of the goal of reading 10,000 pages a year. In my defense, the book "The Humane Interface" by Raskin is a very dense book, both typographically and content-wise. Oh well, I only have myself to blame.</p>
