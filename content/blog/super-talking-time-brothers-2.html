<p>Today I discovered the game <a href="http://www.gamespite.net/talkingtime/showthread.php?t=12407">Super Talking Time Bros 2</a>, a quite fateful re-implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World">Super Mario World</a> game engine as a free PC game. Given the opportunity to have a full-fledged level editor, there was a community effort to produce all the levels that "back then" you wished we're added to the game. It includes references to many other classic games from Nintendo and others and includes quite a few innovative tweaks to a well-known game which remaining faithful to the original.</p>

<p>For me, that game is partly nostalgic to when I player Super Mario World as a kid, yet mixed with the freshness of new ideas that come from a community effort. It's still a bit awkward to play on a keyboard, and it doesn't run on a Mac or Linux (well, I haven't yet tried using <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>). Yet, I remained astounded by the near-professional quality of the levels, so much so that it easily compares (and at times surpasses) the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Super_Mario_Bros.">New Mario Brothers</a> series. So, highly recommended.</p>
