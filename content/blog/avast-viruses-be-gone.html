<div class='posterous_autopost'>A few days ago I updated my copy of the Avast ( <a href="http://www.avast.com/">http://www.avast.com/</a> ) anti-virus software to Internet Security for 3 PCs for 2 years. Now, paying so much for an anti-virus software for Windows nowadays seems like I just got hooked on a scam selling me a false sense of security. Looking at the many blunders Symantec went through in the past few weeks admitting their code was stolen a few years ago (and that it went public once the blackmailers stopped asking them for money), I can understand.    But Avast is not only free (without ads too), but also by simply using it you can tell that they're serious about security. For example, they can let you run software in a sandbox, isolating it from the rest of the OS as if it was running in a virtual machine. Or it can catch trojans from a web site through its HTTP connection so that it doesn't even have a chance to load on your computer. Or its "boot-time" virus scanning, making it impossible for any virus to trick Avast into not detecting it. Another thing is how much low-resource it is when running, a big plus when I'm running it in a virtual machine with only 512MB or RAM.    So I put my money where my mouth is and bought the full version, with the firewall thing and a more advanced version of sandboxing and so on. And, best of all, it does all of that and gets out of my way when I work.</div>
