<p>After almost 4 years, it seems like my headphones started calling it quits. The cushiony leather is flaking, and the cord is breaking apart. Nothing that scotch tape can&#8217;t fix to give it an extra year of use.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m surprised it still lasts that long, especially considering I used it in Montr√©al&#8217;s weather almost each day. I owned many headphones, cheap and expensive ones, that would disintegrate on their own in ideal environments and casual use only after a year or so. This is why I was so adamant to spend so much money on those <a href="http://www.bose.ca/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort_15/index.jsp">Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones</a>. For the price it still lacked iPod-friendly features like volume and play controls. Well, the &#8220;mobile communications kit&#8221; sucked. Otherwise they&#8217;re amazing.</p>

<p>And now perusing their site I see that they sell cushion replacements, and a cord with volume and play controls. I feel like a sucker customer again&#8230; I&#8217;m using those headphones over a thousand hours, so I&#8217;ll rationalize the spending as an &#8220;investment&#8221; and environment-friendly reuse.</p>
