<p>First: My results for my <a href="http://benad.livejournal.com/17464.html">2009 resolutions</a>? Well, I kind of half-finished my <a href="http://benad.me/">web site</a>, and I had to learn some Python for work. No open-source contribution. So, it's 1.5 out of 3.</p>
<p>So, here's what I'm thinking of for 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement some software that makes use of the <a href="http://www.amqp.org/">Advanced Message Queuing Protocol</a>. Or could be some embedded "message queue" for Java. As long as I design something based on message queues, without necessarily having to use a programming language made for it like <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>.</li>
<li>Make some teaching material about Perl or BASH for work.</li>
<li>Get a new MacBook Pro with a solid-state drive and a Windows 7 partition. This means I have to migrate my current Windows XP Pro partition to a pure virtual machine. And do so without breaking all the software I licensed.</li>
<li>Finish my <a href="http://benad.me/">web site</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that's enough for the year.</p>
