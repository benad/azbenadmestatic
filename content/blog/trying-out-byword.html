<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>So today I&rsquo;m trying to write this post using the iOS application <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a>, a plain text and Markdown editor.</p>  <p>It works quite well with Dropbox integration, though at first I was a bit lost about how to display the shortcuts (slide the bar above the keyboard). The editor has more Markdown-oriented shortcuts than Nebulous, but has far less file management options, and is less customizable. Otherwise, I really like the interface and I easily see myself using it as my main editor for Posterous (and eventually Squarespace).</p></div>
