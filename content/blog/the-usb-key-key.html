<p>So I received from Amazon the <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/LaCie-iamakey-Flash-Drive-131106/dp/B004FHI1E6/">LaCie iamaKey</a> 16GB USB flash drive. I tend to use the term "USB Key" for all USB flash storage, but that's a misnomer... Most USB flash drives come with some small string so that you can hook it up to a keychain, but given the length of the string and the (poor) quality of the plastic casing, I wouldn't be surprised if the "key" survives less than a few months in your keychain. The "iamaKey" is shaped and metallic like a key. It's made to be "roughed up" in a keychain. So, at last, a USB key that's a key.</p>

<p>Also, with the software gizmos that came with the key, there was a postable version of truecrypt, and a one-year subscription of 16GB (on the of the base free 5GB) for their <a href="https://www.wuala.com/">Wuala</a> storage thing. Unlike <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> and the like, it's based on some <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">FUSE</a>-based virtual drive, and (more importantly) everything is encrypted <em>before</em> anything is sent to their servers. Their iPhone app is rather limited (read-only essentially), but the security is a big, big plus for me.</p>
