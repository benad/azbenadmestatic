<p>My <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2013/4/26/on-c-templates">two</a> <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2013/5/21/on-c-operator-overloading">previous</a> articles were quite mild in their critique of the C++ programming language. This may be party due to the fact that I've now moved on to other programming languages, and thus avoided learning C++ more in depth. <em>(Actually, I'm hopelessly late even on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99">C99</a>, which was released two years after I learned C)</em></p>

<p>But another more enterprising developer learned in depth C++ and <a href="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/">throughly listed</a> what he didn't like about its design. <a href="http://yosefk.com/">Yossi Kreinin</a>'s site is actually a point-by-point refute of the highly biased <a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/index.html">C++ FAQ Lite</a>, though it is summarized in the aptly named page <a href="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/defective.html">Defective C++</a>.</p>

<p>After reading what Yossi wrote, I may even go back to my <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2009/9/20/apj-4-learning-perl-transcription.html">original assessment</a> of other languages like Perl. While Perl's strange syntax can be essentially explained by it being inspired by older scripting languages popular in UNIX-like systems, it does avoid the pitfall of attempting to present a design style beyond its original mandate of a quick-and-dirty language. C++ should have never been both based on C <em>and</em> be an object-oriented programming language within the same syntax style. I really believe that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Objective-C's</a> approach of keeping the two design styles (C and OO) distinctively different in their syntax would have been the proper approach for C++. Oh well.</p>
