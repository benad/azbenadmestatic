<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>A <a href="http://blog2.easydns.org/2012/02/29/verisign-seizes-com-domain-registered-via-foreign-registrar-on-behalf-of-us-authorities/">blog post</a> made by <a href="http://easydns.com/">easyDNS</a> revealed the first case where, given a US federal warrant, a web site hosted, operated and registered outside the USA was shut down internationally. Why? Because all &ldquo;.com&rdquo;, &ldquo;.org&rdquo; and a few other root domains are owned by Verisign, an American company. So, if you have a &ldquo;.com&rdquo; domain, you&rsquo;re at the mercy of US law.</p>  <p>Now, my <a href="http://benad.me/">seldom-updated web site</a> is unaffected because it ends with &ldquo;.me&rdquo;, but this is still a worrying situation. Not anymore the USA acts like a &ldquo;benevolent dictator&rdquo; on key Internet infrastructure, and the more they act like bullies on intellectual property issues, the more likely root he root domain name service will split up. Maybe that&rsquo;s for the better.</p></div>
