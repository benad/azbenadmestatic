<p>As the reviews of the new MacBook Pro Retina are coming in, I noticed two questions that are often left often unanswered.</p>

<p>First: How does the glass screen fare with office lights? I've been using an HP Folio 13 "ultrabook" at work and, based on <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5998/macbook-pro-retina-display-analysis">Anandtech's report</a>, the MacBook Pro should be considerably better. Still, going back to a glass display is a throwback to the horrible CRTs we had to use for years.</p>

<p>Second: How do you lock down that thing? Again, using the HP Folio as a reference, all we can do to "lock" these in an office environment is to place it in a locked cabinet, which isn't great since for obvious reason you'll have to at very least suspend or shut down the laptop prior doing so. If the laptop is used mostly as a portable display, no problem, but when it's your primary work machine this can get annoying.</p>

<p>Actually, but focusing so much on the consumer market for those small-form laptops, they may be losing the way laptops are typically used in an office environment. I'm not too fond of laptops in a workplace, but still having locking cabinets for each employee doesn't seem to be something most offices will be ready for in the short term.</p>

<p>So, by "Pro" Apple meant don't use it in an office?</p>
