title = "Upgrading to the Pi 400"

---

Two years ago, I was tempted to replace my [Raspberry Pi 3 Linux server](https://benad.me/blog/2017/11/06/raspberry-pi-your-home-linux-server/) with a [Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). I would have taken this occasion to upgrade it from its [Raspbian OS](https://www.raspbian.org/) that was based on Debian 9 to the new [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/), based on Debian 10.

Looking at the various kits for the Pi 4, I changed my mind. Unlike the Pi 3, a fan to cool it down is highly recommended, and one of my requirements is to have a fan-less server. Sure, you can run it without a fan, but that requires running it at a significantly slower clock speed, especially if you put it inside a case. To compare, most the of Pi 3 case kits included a heatsink, while for the Pi 4 most of them included a fan.

Otherwise, the Pi 4 would have been a significant upgrade, especially if you use it as a server. As usual, the CPU is faster, and it supports a lot more RAM (from 0.5 - 1 GB to 2 - 8 GB). More importantly, it supports USB 3 for external devices. To compare, the Pi 3 was limited to USB 2, and the Ethernet port's bandwidth was shared with the USB 2 ports, so all file transfers from an external USB drive would be at best half of the maximum speed of USB 2.

The [Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/) is internally similar to the Pi 4, but since it comes in the form of a keyboard, it has enough surface to not require any kind of fan. That was perfect for me, so I bought it as soon as I could.

I backed up the micro SD card of my Pi 3 to a [SquashFS](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/SquashFS-HOWTO/index.html) disk image. I found this more practical than using TAR, since it can be mounted (even as user-space with [squashfuse](https://github.com/vasi/squashfuse)) and allows me to copy individual files instantly from it.

As for setting up the Pi 400, I changed my mind about using Raspberry Pi OS, and installed Ubuntu 20.04 on it. Since I want to use it primarily as a server and don't really care about having a GUI, I used Ubuntu Server. This is officially supported by Canonical, and they have a [nice tutorial about how to set it up](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi). If I want to set up a desktop environment in it later, Ubuntu Server can easily be upgraded to [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.net/).

Another big advantage of Ubuntu Server over the Pi OS is that it runs the Pi in ARMv8 64-bit mode rather than the older v7 in 32-bit mode. This means that, combined with the Ubuntu ecosystem, there is a lot more software available for it than Pi OS. In addition, this now means that [all my "computers" are finally 64-bit processors](https://benad.me/blog/2017/08/23/forever-64-bit/).

So, after using a little while, I'm still blown away by its performance compared to the Pi 3. Maybe it's due in part from using a new micro SD card that is almost twice as fast as your typical U1 cards. Yet, when I was testing it with Raspberry Pi OS and lanched Chromium, I could easily tell that its performance could be compared to some lower-end Chromebooks and could be used as a typical modern computer. Beyond using it as a server like I do, the Pi 400 feels like a modern Linux-based equivalent to the [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), and a great machine to learn software or computer engineering.
