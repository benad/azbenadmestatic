<p>The game "<a href="http://www.ftlgame.com/">Faster than Light</a>" is undeniably difficult. It's essentially some kind of Star Trek style ship strategy / adventure that feels a bit like a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29">rogue</a>-like" role playing game. It is quite random, so sometimes the game is more difficult because you're unlucky. Sometimes (often), the difficulty is entirely due to your mistakes. How can you know what to upgrade until it's too late? Should you risk your crew trying to rescue that ship? Or what about attacking that slave ship? For $10, I already spent too much time playing it. Also, this was one of the few <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/64409699/ftl-faster-than-light">Kickstarter game projects</a>.</p>

<p>By the way, I got this game from <a href="http://www.gog.com/">GOG</a> ("Good Old Games"), which just opened its Mac version of the store. Not a lot of games yet, but already I played the free game "<a href="http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/tyrian_2000">Tyrian 2000</a>", an old DOS game, and the emulation was flawless.</p>
