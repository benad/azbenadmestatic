<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Well, the vacation is finished, and now I&rsquo;m back to hectic work. Finished much too late, and I still have a few emails to send. The net result is that I have to go back to my optimized &ldquo;media consumption process&rdquo;, and maybe find ways to optimize things a bit more.</p>  <p>For example, my podcast queue tend to grow too big as the week goes by, meaning I need to trim it down to a more reasonable size. Same thing for reading, be it on my Kindle or audiobooks. Even my Twitter feed needs some trimming down. And now the problem is to find the time to do that trimming&hellip;</p></div>
