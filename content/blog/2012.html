<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>So I planned my vacation days to include my birthday, and hopefully I can do that each year. I&rsquo;ll do my best to not see in the 33rd year of my life an ominous sign. Hopefully, it could be an eventful year, at least one where events are not related to my health or half-broken stomach.</p>  <p>Indeed, in the past two year I was able to recover much to the point where only once or twice a month my stomach turns bad. I&rsquo;m still sensitive health-wise, so a little flu here and there is still worrisome, but not enough for it to impede what has been incredibly difficult work for that past 5 months. And, hey, if the trends continue, I might have to work until 90 before my pension kicks in (if the government doesn&rsquo;t crash under its weight in 15 years), so I have to learn to pace myself.</p></div>
