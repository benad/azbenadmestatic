<p>This is written a little bit early, since I'll do a retrospective of this blogging experiment in the last few days of the year.</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn some new programming language. I still haven't fully decided, though right now it seems to be <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> for Java. The problem though is that whatever language I choose, it may be far too divergent from my workplace's standards to be used there without pissing off other developers.</li>
<li>Learn about microkernels, or read some kernel code. This may not go much beyond learning about small hypervisors, purely as a hobby thing. I really wish though that more common desktop software run as tiny hypervisors of their own, especially since even what we considered "small" like web browsers are quickly approaching the complexity of an OS. Even Chrome quickly became bloated.</li>
<li>Dive deeper in software usability. I read many high-level books, but I think it may be more useful to start digging into cognitive sciences and cognitive psychology. But then, from what I've seen from the praised "leaders" in usability, there isn't much rigor in bridging usability issues with cognitive psychology other than just confirming intuition bias from the author, so finding authors to help bridge the disciplines may be too difficult, at least enough for me to start exploring on my own.</li>
</ol>

<p>There. I think that's enough for one year.</p>
