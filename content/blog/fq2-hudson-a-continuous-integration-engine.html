<p><a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net" />CruiseControl</a> sucks, at least for me, since there's no out-of-the-box integration with version control, and integration with anything is a pain in general.</p>
<p><a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/">Hudson</a> does everything superbly. It runs from a self-deploying WAR file using <a href="http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/">jetty</a> or deploys as usual in any J2EE server.</p>
