<p>Of course I too want to see the last installment of Nolan's Batman movies. Also, I want to see it as it was intended by the director, meaning in English and in (full-sized) IMAX. So, that restricts the number of cinemas in southern Québec to one, in downtown Montréal. It is quite close to where I work, so I could see it during a weekday.</p>

<p>The issue is that <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> lasts 2 hours and 45 minutes, so to get a seat plus the previews that makes it 3 hours. The evening projection starts at 7:20 PM, so it would end at roughly 10:20 PM. Well, I usually <em>sleep</em> at 10 PM, so given the time it takes me to get back home, I'd be quite tired...</p>

<p>I guess I'll just wait a little bit so that there's less of a crowd, and see it in the weekend during the afternoon. Or maybe save some money and add in flexibility by watching the non-IMAX version, which won't make me as nauseous if I come late and sit at the front row.</p>
