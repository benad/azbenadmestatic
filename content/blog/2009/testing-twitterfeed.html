<p>Let's see if this works... If all works well, this will post something to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">twitter</a> through <a href="http://ping.fm">ping.fm</a> through <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">twitterfeed</a> within roughly 30 minutes. More details to come soon.</p>
<p><i>Later...</i> Well, <a href="http://twitter.com/benad/status/4324762217">that worked</a>. It also posted into delicious.com <a href="http://delicious.com/benad/ping.fm">here</a>, though since twitterfeed already shortened the link to bit.ly I'll have to edit these after the posting. The big advantage of using ping.fm is that it's going to be much easier for me to post quick links to twitter and manage them later on delicious or wherever.</p>
