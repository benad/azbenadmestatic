<p><i>I'll skip the audio post for now, as it won't record well in the metro...</i></p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I read a <a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2007-March/000849.html">post</a> made by <a href="http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/">Kragen Sitaker</a> on his <a href="http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/mailing-lists.html">mailing list</a> about his journey as a programmer. Well, his experience and lessons about them were unoriginal at best (I'll write more about this later). In comparison, mine's quite unique, and might even explain a bit why I tend to focus on programming from a software designer's perspective.</p>
<p>So, for the following few posts, I'll present "A Programmer's Journey", starting from my beginnings on the Macintosh to the present.</p>
