<p>Trying to make sense of the hype behind functional languages like <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> and many other implementations for JRE, just to discover that what I really liked was the stack-less distributed messaging pattern.</p>
<p>An interesting standard is <a href="http://jira.amqp.org/confluence/display/AMQP/Advanced+Message+Queuing+Protocol">AMQP</a>, with many implementations including <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>.</p>
