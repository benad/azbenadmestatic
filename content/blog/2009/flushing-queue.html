<p>I've been quite tired for the past 3 months, so over time I piled up a bunch of stuff I wanted to write about. I'm still too tired/lazy to write a complete article about each of them, and since I badly want to write about the iPhone 3G S I'm going to "flush the queue" today, "executive summary" style.</p>
