<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Shutter Island, the 2010 Martin Scorsese movie, is a very effective detective and horror movie. While the story itself is not the greatest, it is brilliantly executed by Scorsese. Its many accolades and nominations are well deserved, be it for the art direction, acting, music, sets and so on. DiCaprio outdoes himself in this movie rather than just being there for his looks or name.</p>  <p>Halfway through the movie it reminded me a bit of Hitchcock&rsquo;s own movies, in which so much rested on his great ability to set the mood through every single thing on screen, yet all subdued to the narrative. In effect, he turned relatively average books into captivating and engaging movies. Few directors can be compared to Hitchcock for thrillers and suspense, and yet Scorsese did it.</p>  <p>So, yes, go out and rent or buy this movie if you&rsquo;re fed up with franchises, sequels and movies that rely too much on star power. Well, unless you&rsquo;re scared too easily.</p></div>
