<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I&rsquo;m nearing the end of my 3-year contract with Rogers, and it&rsquo;s easy to tell since they already started spamming me by mail and <a href="http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-866-203-7150">with calls</a>.</p>  <p>The contract I got on the release date of the iPhone 3GS is half-decent. Though limited to 50 minutes a month, it&rsquo;s unlimited after 6PM and on the weekends. Unlimited SMS, MMS (who uses that?), call display and voicemail, all extras. An expensive $30 data plan, but then it&rsquo;s for 6GB. Big total? Including taxes, $100 per month.</p>  <p>But now the tables hav turned. I have now wifi access at work, and tend to cache all my data, so I could easily fit in 1GB per month. Oh, and I moved to an unlocked iPhone 4S that can work on almost all carriers in Canada. So, Rogers is trying to keep me with new crappy Locked Android phones with special prices on 3-year contracts? Ha!</p>  <p>I think I&rsquo;ll have a lot of fun negotiating this summer.</p></div>
