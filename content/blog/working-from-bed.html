<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Even though it&rsquo;s been almost a year since the last time I had to stay home because I was too sick, I&rsquo;m still a bit worried about how I could still be able to work a little bit while being in bed. (Or that&rsquo;s a twisted excuse for being too lazy to get out of bed one day.) Well, now with my iPhone (and conceivably using an Android phone), I could actual do that.</p>  <p>First, the iPhone support Microsoft ActiveSync for Exchange 2010, so at the very least I have full access to my email, corporate address book and calendar. Also, the iPhone supports L2TP, PPTP and Cisco VPN, so I can connect directly to work&rsquo;s VPN network, and from there access my intranet servers (I maintain a few servers). Through that VPN connection, I can use iSSH to access some SSH servers, VNC or Windows Remote Desktop screens (well, it&rsquo;s not as fast as when using a real keyboard and mouse, but it does the job). Finally, for meetings, the iPhone is still a phone, I can use Skype to save on my minutes, and I can use Cisco&rsquo;s WebEx or LogMeIn&rsquo;s &ldquo;join.me&rdquo; to get to online meetings. Finally I can use trillian for IM.</p>  <p>Of course I would have to get out of bed from time to time to eat or go to the bathroom. And I may pass out from time to time. Hmm&hellip; I guess avoiding getting sick and recovering when I do might be more important&hellip;</p></div>
