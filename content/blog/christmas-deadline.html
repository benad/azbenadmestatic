<p>If your work is even tangentially related to consumer electronics, this time of the year is rush time. This celebration of unabashed consumerism helps electronic and software companies increase their revenue, all because of this chaotic fever of buying stuff you don&#8217;t really need. I still remember a few years ago when cellphone network providers would convince people to buy a locked phone (normally tied to an expensive 3-year contract) as a &#8220;present&#8221;.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s being released this year? Windows 8, Microsoft Surface, Wii U, iPhone 5, new iPod touches, iPad mini (maybe), countless new tablets, cell phones, e-readers&#8230; Unless your update cycle fits the November-January time frame, you really don&#8217;t need all that stuff. But if you&#8217;re due for an update, I&#8217;d recommend you wait a little bit to avoid the rush.</p>

<p>Compounded with all of that, there&#8217;s also Winter starting. No wonder I end up being so exhausted by the end of December that I need to take a week off from work.</p>
