<p>I'm posting this mainly to avoid boredom, and also to write more notes about interesting sites I found in the past month.</p>
<p>First, Lifehacker did <a href="http://lifehacker.com/397792/five-best-windows-maintenance-tools">a very good article on Windows maintenance tools</a>. While there's surely been thousands of such lists, this is the first one I've seen that's small, to the point, and good. The tools are: <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/">CCleaner</a>, <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/">Revo Uninstaller</a>, <a href="http://www.auslogics.com/disk-defrag">Auslogics Disk Defrag</a>, <a href="http://www.kessels.com/Jkdefrag/">JkDefrag</a> and <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/index.html">Spybot Search &amp; Destroy</a>.</p>
<p>Second, <a href="http://supergenpass.com/">Supergenpass</a> is an amazing, secure JavaScript bookmarklet (with no server-side storage or transfer) that generates secure passwords based on your master password and the site's domain. An amazing free open-source alternative to password managers (not that I don't like <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>...)</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://hellotxt.com/">HelloTxt</a> is a service that updates your "status" on many services, like <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, in one step. This is the only one I've seen that actually works and supports over 20 services. Also works with email and mobile web browsers.</p>
<p>OK, that's it for now.</p>
