<p>Now that I kind of finished buying Christmas gifts for everyone, I have to make decisions about what to buy <i>next</i>, ideally after Christmas. My principle is that I don't move on to the next "buy" unless I "finished" the preceding one. A habit from my childhood, I guess.</p>
<p>So I'm stuck between two things. First, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000HIVQAS/">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, season 1</a>. They haven't released yet season 2 in a season box, and buying all those expensive "limited editions" would not only be expensive (7 * $70 CAN), but would take too much <i>physical space</i>. So, why? Well, it's the only "japanimation" I can watch without getting sick halfway through, so maybe it's because it's really good. While I find the writing and style to be annoying from time to time, it is still overall one of the best animated action dramas out there, Japanese or not.</p>
<p>Second, <a href="http://www.recordstore.co.uk/global/productdetail.jsp?productPK=unittest-KEh3nV33Xwpj5KtiqN3IEb-13">GU01:11 and GU12:21</a>. Or something like 48 hours of the best DJ mixes, including early works from the "big names" (Oakenford, Sasha, Digweed, and of course Warren, Seaman and Deep Dish).</p>
<p>Either way, I have for 2 or 3 weeks of "entertainment" minimum. I'll have to think about it.</p>
