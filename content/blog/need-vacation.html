<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>On this early summer day (hurray for global warming), those are the hints I need a few vacation days:</p>  <ul> <li>I can barely multitask at work, so listening to music or podcasts while I work is out of the question. Result? My podcast queue is getting huge.</li> <li>Getting late on outside-of-workplace work, like my taxes.</li> <li>Even if I had the time to do it, I don&rsquo;t feel like I want to watch a movie.</li> <li>I want to avoid using computers for a few days (<em>gaspe!</em>).</li> </ul>   <p>If all goes well, I should have half of the first week and the second week of April off. For now, I&rsquo;m trying to relax by listening to old CDs on my Bluray player while writing this on my iPad (physical music media feels weird)&hellip;</p></div>
