<p>Since I&#8217;m tired, here are two &#8220;end of series&#8221; recently released I&#8217;ll recommend.</p>

<p>This week is the beginning of the last season of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/30-rock/">30 Rock</a>. The series could have ended last season if it was a little bit longer to finish all the character arcs, but they&#8217;re milking it. The writing isn&#8217;t as &#8220;balls to the walls&#8221; crazy as in the first two seasons, but the writing remains thoughtful and funny.</p>

<p>Also, the audio book version of <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B009IWRARC&amp;qid=1349398908&amp;sr=1-1">That Is All by John Hodgman</a> , the last of his series of &#8220;complete world knowledge&#8221;. It is a great ensemble performance of the absurd. I was actually introduced to the books from the first audiobook, and since then I was hooked.</p>
