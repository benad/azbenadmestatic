<div class="posterous_autopost"><p>It happened twice in that many weeks that fixing my code's design "automagically" fixed bugs I couldn't figure out otherwise. Yes, "brute force" software development can work, but one tiny mistake in a volume of code can be impossible to track down, let alone comprehend.  Now, that may seem like an overstatement, especially since software design can be synonymous to bloated object-oriented design patterns, but fitting in within the same concept some large swat of code makes it much simpler to prove to oneself that it is correct at this point, and as such all of it is correct.  Oh, and I *love* being able to understand what's going on in my code rather than it being a mess.</p></div>
