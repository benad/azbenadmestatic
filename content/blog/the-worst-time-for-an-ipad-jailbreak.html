<p>As step 1 of applying the <a href="http://ijailbreaknow.com/uncategorized/absinthe-2.0-download-available-for-ios-5.1.1-untethered-jailbreak/">recently released iOS 5.1.1 jailbreak</a>, I had to flash the firmware of my iPad to restore 5.1.1. And them a thunderstorm started, while the iPad was updating its firmware on a Mac Mini. If there was any tiny problem with electricity, my iPad would have went <em>poof</em>!</p>

<p>The trick is to use laptops as much as possible for firmware updates of any kind, since both the laptop and device have their own built-in battery in case of a power outage. No wonder <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10209580-92.html">Google is using laptop batteries on each server as a distributed UPS</a>. But then compared to even cheap desktops laptops are underpowered, so it balances out.</p>

<p>OK, back to my "jailbreaking"...</p>
