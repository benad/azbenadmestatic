<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I am of the many that have a 8-hours per day, 5-days a week daytime job. But I am one of the rare cases where what I like to do for fun and what I do for a living are the same.</p>  <p>An interesting aspect of this world of computing is how it is accessible to all. It wasn&rsquo;t the case before, since access to &ldquo;computers&rdquo; was a work privilege for only a few people, and even there it was a time-share. But since the early 80s, roughly when I was born, personal computers are commonplace. The same can be said on Internet access. Before, it was only available in a few universities or military institutions. Now with Wi-Fi, 3G and LTE phones you are connected (sadly still with IPv4) at all times.</p>  <p>So when I&rsquo;m not at work, I can still learn, explore and have fun with software development. Even if I were unemployed, I would surely help out some open source project, or make my own. So, does that mean that even when I&rsquo;m not at work I&rsquo;m still working because I enjoy software development at all times? Or the corollary: How is it possible for software developers to not keep on &ldquo;working&rdquo; outside of work, unless they&rsquo;re lukewarm about their field in the first place?</p>  <p>Now, before you brand me as an obsessed software developer, I have to note that I do indeed do other things in life than just coding. Hey, even reading this blog you can notice that I write about lots of different things. I consider myself a well-rounded intellectual, but avoid admitting so because that has such a negative connotation nowadays. The important question would be: Could I flat out let go of software development, and move on to other things? For now I don&rsquo;t see any reason to do so (somehow software engineering still fascinates me), but I suspect that since so many other things interest me, be it music, writing or design, that I wouldn&rsquo;t have too many regrets in moving to another field. As long as I get a job, that is.</p></div>
