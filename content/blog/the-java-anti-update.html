<p>On the heels of <a href="http://blog.avast.com/2012/08/30/blackhats-adopt-latest-java0day/">two zero-days vulnerabilities found in Java 1.7</a>, Oracle released Java 1.7u7 today. Being security-conscious, I installed the update, but still wondered why the Java control panel in Windows didn't pick up the update automatically.</p>

<p>It just so happened that after installing the JRE 1.7, for some work project I had to install the JDK 1.5, which came with the JRE 1.5. While installing the JRE was optional, accidentally doing so <em>overwrote</em> the Java control panel of 1.7, effectively disabling automatic updates. In the end, I didn't need the JRE 1.5 for the project, so I uninstalled it and reinstalled 1.7u7.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the Mac version also placed an updater in the Mac control panel, and that worked well.</p>
