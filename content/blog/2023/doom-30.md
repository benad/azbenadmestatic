Thirty years after its original release, it's impressive to see that the modding community around [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%281993_video_game%29) remains active to this day. The recent port of Doom by Bethesda has a few [hand-picked add-on level packs](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Official_add-ons), including a few new releases, including [Anomaly Report](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Anomaly_Report) by valkiriforce and [SIGIL II](https://romero.com/sigil) released this month by John Romero, one of the designers of the original Doom game.
