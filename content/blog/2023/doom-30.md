Thirty years after its original release, it's impressive to see that the modding community around [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%281993_video_game%29) remains active to this day. The recent port of Doom by Bethesda has a few [hand-picked add-on level packs](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Official_add-ons), including a few new releases, including [Anomaly Report](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Anomaly_Report) by valkiriforce and [SIGIL II](https://romero.com/sigil) released this month by John Romero, one of the designers of the original Doom game.

What interest me more is how new technology and ideas are integrated into Doom's game engine. While nowadays Doom is better known to be ported to as many "computing environments" as possible, integrating new technologies into its engine can be more challenging.

A common modification to Doom was to make it "full 3D", which often involves replacing the game's objects with 3D models. But that often visually clashes with Doom's original design, and our sense of nostalgia regarding its "chunky" 2D sprites. Instead, the [Voxel Doom II](https://www.moddb.com/mods/voxel-doom-ii) mod by Cacoward replaces the 2D sprites with cubic [voxels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel). At a distance and at right angles, the voxel-based objects look nearly identical to their original 2D form, but when looked at closely or at new angles, you can see that they "shape out" of their original flat designs. This is especially more visible when looking at corpses, which originally had only a single "angle" and would always face the place, or when looking up or down at objects using the [ZDoom](https://zdoom.org/index) engine. The end result looks amazing, with impressive amount of detail to match against the "spirit" or the original graphics while still have some artistic license for those "unseen" angles. This YouTube video from Lagoonatic inspects in depth (pun intended) this mod: "[DOOM in STUNNING 3D! Voxel Doom II](https://youtu.be/nN_th4cnSfI)".
