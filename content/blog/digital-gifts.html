<p>Christmas Day celebrations are starting to be a little bit more awkward, with more and more gifts being digital goods that have no physical form.</p>

<p>What I'd recommend is at very least buy it in a form that has an activation code, because instantly sending the license to someone by email days before the gift is supposed to be given is, well, weird. Beyond that, you can always place the various codes (plus instructions on where to use them,  depending of skill level) in a nice gift card. Finally, if you can bundle that with some other physical gift, that would be the best.</p>

<p>I'm surprised though that when Facebook first implemented "virtual gifts", they were completely useless avatars or whatnots that didn't tie to any goods, physical or virtual. I guess you can get activation codes from online stores and simply send them as private messages, but I still think this was a lost opportunity.</p>
