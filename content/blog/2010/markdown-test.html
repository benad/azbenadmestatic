<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>This is actually a <em>test post</em>. Some context: For the long term, I am<br /> planning to move my blog to <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a> since I always end up<br /> writing my posts in <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> and sending them by email.<br /> <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> has an <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=187">email interface</a>, but quite frankly<br /> writing posts with HTML tags on an iPhone is challenging.</p>  <p>Recently, Posterous started supporting the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> syntax, which<br /> is exactly the kind of syntax I wanted for email posting. So, I&rsquo;ve set<br /> up a &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; Blog at <a href="http://benad-blog.posterous.com/">benad-blog.posterous.com</a> that autoposts to <a href="http://benad.livejournal.com">benad.livejournal.com</a>. I&rsquo;ll keep my <a href="http://benad.posterous.com/">default Posterous site</a> for micro-blogging.</p>  </div><br/><br/><p><b>Edit</b>: Seems like email posting line breaks everything at 70 characters if I don't hard line break my input, which broke one of the links in the process. Oh well, almost there.</p>
