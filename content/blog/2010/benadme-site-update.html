<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I haven&rsquo;t updated my web site in a while, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I was totally idle.</p>  <p>I tried to re-style the page with a custom font loaded with <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/web-fonts-with-font-face/">CSS3 font-face</a> but it <a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2010/04/05/experimenting-with-web-fonts-on-the-ipad/">miserably failed on my iPad</a> when using proper font variants (bold, italics) that would have gracefully degraded in older browsers. In a way, without an iPad, I would have never known that my site could consistently crash its browser&hellip;</p>  <p>I also streamlined my work process by creating a new <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> repository on <a href="http://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> so that I can sync and backup my source repository easily, and made a quick-and-dirty <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> to my-XML-format converter.</p>  <p>I&rsquo;m seriously starting to dislike <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>&rsquo;s editor on the iPad and iPhone, so I&rsquo;ll be moving to <a href="http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html">GoodReader</a>&rsquo;s built-in text editor, write the page in Markdown (at least the subset supported by my converter) and use my <a href="http://www.me.com/">iDisk</a> as an in-between place to transfer the file to my laptop (I could use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> too).</p></div>
