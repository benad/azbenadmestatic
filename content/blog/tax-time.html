<p>Not! For my part, I already received my tax returns, so I don't care.</p>

<p>I may be too much of a computer guy, but amongst my coworkers (meaning normal people) I'm not only the lone one that programmed his own spreadsheet or software to compute his taxes, but also the only one to write the results on the paper form.</p>

<p>It's as if, in a way, I know enough about software to not fully trust it, and even less trust closed-source commercial software for important things. Like one which would make you end up in jail if you mess it up. Is it yet another form of complacency in the face of convenience, like privacy, health and pollution?</p>

<p>Meh. It's just roughly 50% of your income, so who cares...</p>
