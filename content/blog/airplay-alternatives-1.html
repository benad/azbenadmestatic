<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/airplay/">Apple's AirPlay</a> may be nice, but it essentially locks you in with the <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a> receiver. While personally I tend to use <a href="http://projectswithlove.com/streamtome/">StreamToMe</a> to stream any content from my computer to my iPhone or iPad, there are a few alternatives that let you stream things <em>out</em> of an iOS device into a computer or another iOS device.</p>

<p>For music, the <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/ios/releasenotes.php">new version</a> of <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/ios/">AirFoil Speakers Touch</a> can act as an AirPlay audio device, letting you stream iTunes or any iOS device's sound into another iOS device. It's pretty inexpensive at $3. That way, if you have some cheap speakers for an iPod Touch, you can easily stream iTunes wirelessly into it.</p>

<p>For video and mirroring the entire view of an iOS device on a computer, here is the spectacular <a href="http://www.airserverapp.com/">AirServer</a>. This works great if your computer is connected to an HDTV. It's not only pretty cheap at $15, but I often used it to stream a YouTube video or even a game to my TV, all without having to buy a separate $100 Apple TV receiver.</p>
