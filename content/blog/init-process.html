<div class='posterous_autopost'>So, as I mentioned yesterday, here are the tools and process I'll use to make it possible for me to post one blog post per day for a year. <p /> I'll use email as my primary interface to post. This if for two reasons. First, email clients (Email in iOS and Gmail) aggressively save and synchronize automatically email drafts, this minimizing the risk that I'll lose a post I'm writing midway. Second, if I travel and I get stuck with an horrible data plan, I can still send an email without it costing me an a and a leg. <p /> I'll keep using Posterous ( <a href="http://posterous.com/">http://posterous.com/</a> ) because of its powerful cross-posting capabilities, but frankly I was more than once tempted to move to tumblr, which already mirrors my posts ( <a href="http://benad.tumblr.com/">http://benad.tumblr.com/</a> , and also on Livejournal at <a href="http://benad.livejournal.com/">http://benad.livejournal.com/</a> ). One negative against Posterous is that backups are difficult. They have an API, which I tried by using a script ( <a href="http://riduidel.posterous.com/posterous-backup-script-v2">http://riduidel.posterous.com/posterous-backup-script-v2</a> ) made by Nicolas Delsaux ( <a href="http://posterous.com/users/bi092oXai">http://posterous.com/users/bi092oXai</a> ), but the rate limits on the API requests are so abysmally low that it's too hard to make an effective backup script. Ultimately, my Sent folders of my iCloud and Gmail accounts are backed up, so if I consistently use email that won't be a problem. <p /> I may indulge myself into using Markdown syntax from time to time, but normally for simple posts I'll write them in plain text only. <p /> To avoid some "blank page syndrome", I'll be keeping a text file in Dropbox that lists out future subject ideas and some kind of daily schedule. Hey, I still have to find 354 different subjects to talk about... I may have from time to time to split a subject into multiple (not necessarily contiguous) posts, so avoid spending more than 30 minutes a day on this. I may also preemptively to some research in advance of certain posts, and keep track of those notes in my schedule page or Evernote. I may even cross-post some of those longer subjects into proper articles for my web site. We'll see.</div>
