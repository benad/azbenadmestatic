<p>From time to time I'd like to listen to a few specific episodes of a podcast on my iPhone, but without having to subscribe to its RSS feed, or even downloading the audio file from a password-protected site. It just so happens that with <a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/">Downcast</a> you can do that.</p>

<p>In the tools section of Downcast, you can import individual audio files that were transferred to the app through iTunes into either an existing podcast subscription or in a new "fake" podcast. Once that's done, you can then easily create a new playlist for that podcast, and manually order the episodes the way you want to.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to remain PC-free and download the audio files from the iPhone, you can do that too. In any app that lets you open the audio file using the "Open With..." option, you'll be able to open the file with Downcast to import it (though one audio file at a time). To download the audio file, I use <a href="http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html">GoodReader</a>, though you may prefer a more "traditional" web browser that supports a download manager like the paid version of <a href="http://atomicwebbrowser.com/">Atomic Web Browser</a> or the free ad-supported <a href="http://www.ilegendsoft.com/software/mercurybrowser/">Mercury Browser</a>.</p>
