<p>Playing <a href="http://superhexagon.com/">Super Hexagon</a> feels like I&#8217;m playing <a href="http://bittripgame.com/">Bit.TRIP</a> again. The most difficult thing in the game is not the reaction time nor the spinning camera, but more the limits of my dexterity. Eventually I get some &#8220;muscle memory&#8221;, but with some of the patterns in the game I need to execute movements with a precise <em>rhythm</em> in my actions. Of course, I tend to place the music in the back of my mind and try to memorize, with trial and error, what should be this rhythm.</p>

<p>Well, the music was the whole hint. Like <a href="http://bittripgame.com/bittrip-runner.html">Bit.TRIP Runner</a>, all movements can be timed <em>exactly</em> with the music as a guide, rather than active memory should be consciously fighting against. Yes, it still pushes me to my dexterity limits (and hand cramps), but instead of fighting some patterns with a rush of adrenaline, I just have to go with the &#8220;intuitive&#8221; flow that the music is guiding me through.</p>

<p>As a result, I beat all my time records in the game in one sitting yesterday. Even today I beat my record on the 5th (of 6) levels. This may be one of the few games where, in the end, I might <em>fairly</em> never be able to complete, and that&#8217;s a rare thing to lose at a game and not feel frustrated one bit.</p>
