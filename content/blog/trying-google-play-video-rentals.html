<div class="posterous_autopost"><p>So, out of curiosity for this new <a href="https://play.google.com">Google Play</a> thing, I rented a movie to try it out (the movie &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376136/">The Rum Diary</a>&rdquo;, if you want to ask).</p>  <p>The interface for playing the video is either an Android phone or tablet (which I don&rsquo;t have) or an embedded video player. Actually, clicking on the links within the player, it clearly redirects to YouTube&rsquo;s section for movie rentals.</p>  <p>It&rsquo;s still a bit too expensive (thanks, studios!), and the selection is quite limited (thanks, Canada!), and of course not in HD, but it works. Still, I don&rsquo;t have the time to finish watching the movie tonight, and on top of that it doesn&rsquo;t remember where you left it off like Netflix does. So, Google Play Video is quite lackluster right now, similar to its Book section (compared to Amazon or Kobo or even iBooks). I guess everybody likes to hate Google for distribution.</p>  <p><em>(Oh, and on an unrelated thing, I&rsquo;m writing the Markdown document using the <a href="http://dillinger.io">Dillinger</a> HTML 5 Markdown editor. It works quite well, and is an amazing replacement to the now-dead &ldquo;Showdown&rdquo; Markdown web site.)</em></p></div>
