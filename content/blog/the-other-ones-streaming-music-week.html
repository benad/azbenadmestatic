<p>I tried a few other music streaming apps that work in Canada, but for some reason or another I haven't found them good enough to warrant a full review. Note that I excluded <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> and <a href="http://tunein.com/">TuneIn Radio</a>, two apps I already use and recommend, because Rdio isn't free and TuneIn Radio is mostly for publicly available MP3 and MP4 radio stations.</p>

<p>I don't fully get what is <a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/">Mixcloud</a>. Technically it's a collection of streamable MP3 files, mostly DJ recordings. It has chapter markings like with podcasts, but then it has no apparent offline mode. Outside of music, it points to individual podcast episodes, unordered and messy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.soundtracker.fm/">Soundtracker</a> in theory allows you to listen to songs at the same time as your friends, share playlists, etc. That would be nice if that worked, since in the past two days I had almost non-stop connection issues. Registering didn't make any difference in reliability. And since it doesn't work I can't say much more about it.</p>

<p>I have fond memories of <a href="http://www.live365.com/">Live365</a>, and they'll remain memories. The exclusive list of MP3 stations it has are laden with ads, and you would need to pay upwards to $80 a year to remove the ads. The stations are presented in a flat list that makes little difference to just randomly try them one by one, if you can stomach the 1 minute of ads each time before you can get a hint if the station is any good. And this might have been just pure coincidence, but my iPhone was draining battery at an unusual rate. Did I forget to mention the app is somewhat buggy?</p>
