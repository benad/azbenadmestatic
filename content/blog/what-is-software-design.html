<p>This is a post about my new article on <a href="http://benad.me/">my web site</a> called "<a href="http://benad.me/software_design.xml">What is Software Design</a>". It took me quite too long to write, especially considering this was about "obvious things" to me. Actually, over the years I realized how much a lot of programmers simply "brute force" their way out of difficult programming challenges rather than considering its design. The result is that what is produced is a huge pile of mess, and they find it quite normal that most software becomes bloated and horrible over time.</p>

<p>Now, I have to admit myself that being good at software design require a different set of qualities than what is normally expected out of a programmer. Consideration has to be given to future maintainability and training, meaning if the code is easy to understand. Finding the right design patterns to apply to a given situation can be quite difficult. Designing a programming language <em>well</em> to abstract a complex conceptual domain is even more difficult.</p>

<p>So, now I have something I can point people to that summarize why having good code design is important. I'm not sure it's easy to read enough, but hopefully it makes its point clearly.</p>
