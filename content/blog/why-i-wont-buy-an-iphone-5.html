<p>Because I already have an iPhone 4S, and I'm content with it? It is true that I seem to have infinite wants of computing power from my Macs, but that's because they are general-purpose computing machines that can have infinite potential through their fully flexible programming. But devices? At some point, for their designed purposes, they're just good enough.</p>

<p>Yes, I am planning to upgrade my tablet (iPad) and e-reader (Kobo) in the next few months, but that's because they were not too great for what they were designed for (lack of memory, sluggish). For computers and laptops, I can see that they're clearly overpowered for most users, and because they don't necessarily need programmability, switching to a small function-specific device makes more sense. Even my current MacBook Pro from 2010 is almost "good enough" for my generic-computing needs.</p>

<p>I've never had too much thrill into buying new devices, so those 2 upgrades are well calculated. Really, I'm not a good consumer. So falling into the hype of getting the latest gizmos isn't too appealing to me. The fact that people expect that from me and that I have to make such a public statement may be indicative that our culture has too much consumerism.</p>
