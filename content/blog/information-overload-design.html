<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>To follow up on <a href="http://benad-blog.posterous.com/white-space-design">my rant yesterday</a>, I suspect that today&rsquo;s visual designers obsession with minimalist, simple design with &ldquo;large margins&rdquo; is a reaction to our current digital age.</p>  <p>To contrast, you can observe the way visual design in the mid 80s and 90s <em>embraced</em> sensory over-stimulation, from nearly chaotic representations of &ldquo;cyberspace&rdquo;, to fluorescent colors everywhere. Even then, this wasn&rsquo;t particularly new, as this was influenced by LSD-inspired overly detailed design, that influenced visual arts and movies through the early 2000s with Heavy Metal, Druillet and the well-known Moebius.</p>  <p>But now, there&rsquo;s a nearly anti-intellectual counter-culture from pseudo-technologists that gravitate towards new-agey, <em>faux-spiritual</em> simplification. The age of &ldquo;too clean&rdquo; science-fiction, which took a strong &ldquo;cyberpunk&rdquo; movement to get away from it, is now coming back, but oddly enough without the utopian ideology and just emptiness.</p>  <p>And that was the point I was trying to make. That &ldquo;white space design&rdquo; ultimately tends to be just too short of content, be it philosophical, political, spiritual or otherwise, to be even worty of its inherent pretentiousness. So if you don&rsquo;t have much to say, then embellish it so that at the very least you&rsquo;re entertaining.</p>  <p><em>Says the guy that owns a white iPhone 4S.
