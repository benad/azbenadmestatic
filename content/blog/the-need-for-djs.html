<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>My main gripe about the music streaming service <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> is the lack of per-genre radio stations to discover music. As I started to use the service a year ago, I was overwhelmed by the choice, so at first I just expanded my music horizons to just a bit beyond what I already know.</p>  <p>I understand that a big part of Rdio is the social aspect to discover music, but the problem with that is that I need to know some people with good taste to follow. Well, now, with the redesign, there are some &ldquo;suggested users&rdquo; to follow, so that might help.</p>  <p>In a way, this reminded me of the importance of media curators. Given instant access to an incredibly large collection with no per-access costs, how can you find a way to sort the good stuff from the crap? Before, almost no one except those working within the media industry had that kind of access. Now, anyone can improvise being a DJ, but I suspect most are not good enough &ldquo;taste makers&rdquo; to be one. So, where are the DJs of Internet streaming?</p></div>
