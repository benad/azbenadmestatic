<p>By accident I came across the <a href="http://vsl.co.at/">Vienna Symphonic Library</a>, a sample set of classical orchestra instruments for the EXS24 plugin of <a href="http://www.apple.com/logicpro/">Logic Pro</a>. A <b>LARGE</b> sample set, so detailed you can't tell the difference with the real thing.</p>
<p>Some examples for violin: <a href="http://vsl.co.at/en-us/67/4587/4588.vsl">http://vsl.co.at/en-us/67/4587/4588.vsl</a></p>
<p>But then, considering the price ($500+, $5000 total), I'll stick with my crummy MIDI samples that come with <a href="http://www.apple.com/logicexpress/">Logic Express</a>, or something like that.</p>
