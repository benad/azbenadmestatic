<div class='posterous_autopost'>I'm really busy at work these times, so it's a bit difficult to catch up on all that's happening at the Consumer Electronic Show this week. So what do I do to catch up? <p /> I listen to the podcast Tech News Today ( <a href="http://twit.tv/tnt">http://twit.tv/tnt</a> ), a daily show of tech news that is reporting live each day at CES at 5:30 PM EST and lasts around an hour per episode. Now I can't listen to them live, but I listen to the podcast edition the next morning while going to work. Listening to it at double speed, it fits in my commute. <p /> Then, when I can sit down and use my iPad, I use Flipboard to browse through the Engadget ( <a href="http://www.engadget.com/ces/">http://www.engadget.com/ces/</a> ) and The Verge ( <a href="http://www.theverge.com/ces">http://www.theverge.com/ces</a> and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/7/2690862/ces-2012-biggest-news">http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/7/2690862/ces-2012-biggest-news</a> ) web sites. They tend to cover a bit too much, so I scan only the headlines to see what's interesting to me, or I may simply end up using their respective CES sections on their web sites (using the Opera web browser since those sites tend to be visually heavy). <p /> Finally, the TWiT network, makers of Tech News Today, did lengthy coverage of the show floors, and the videos are posted under TWiT live specials ( <a href="http://twit.tv/show/twit-live-specials">http://twit.tv/show/twit-live-specials</a> ). They are quite lengthy, but I'll catch up on these in the weekend.</div>
