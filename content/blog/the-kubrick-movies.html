<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Now that I finished watching the Harry Potter movies, my next &ldquo;movie cycle&rdquo; will be to see the movies of acclaimed director Stanley Kubrick. I already saw almost all of his movies already, but not in sequence like that, so that will be interesting to see his directorial progression.</p>  <p>The only movie of his I haven&rsquo;t seen, apart from a few unimportant early movies in his career, is &ldquo;The Killing&rdquo;. I won&rsquo;t have to hunt down this DVD though, because it is both available on Netflix and iTunes. For the rest, I have the original DVD box set of Kubrick&rsquo;s movies from Lolita to Eyes Wide Shut, and I got separately the DVDs of Paths of Glory and Spartacus, so I&rsquo;m all set.</p>  <p>In addition, I&rsquo;ve never read <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010625040837/www.interlink.es/cookies/guion/Napoleon.txt">Kubrick&rsquo;s script of Napoleon</a>, a movie that may have been too ambitious even for him. On the blog of The <a href="http://mysterymanonfilm.blogspot.com/">Mystery Man on Film</a> there is also an insightful <a href="http://mysterymanonfilm.blogspot.com/2007/02/stanley-kubricks-napoleon.html">series of articles about Napoleon</a> that too will read as if that was some kind of commentary track on a movie never made.</p>  <p>Now, I am currently more busy than usual, so it could take a few months to go through all the movies.</p></div>
