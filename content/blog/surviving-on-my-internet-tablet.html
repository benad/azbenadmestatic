<p>You remember when I <a href="http://benad.livejournal.com/15257.html">previously implied</a> that my Nokia N810 Internet Tablet could be a laptop replacement? Well, this week it is.</p>

<p>As you may have read from <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/20080703/tc_pcworld/147911">NVIDIA's report of last wednesday</a>, many of their laptop graphics cards have overheating issues. Well, my MacBook Pro's NVIDIA card died the morning before that report.</p>

<p>After being stuck on my N810's for a while, I'm starting to get used to it. Its screen size (800 x 480) is not at bad as it seems. First, it's bigger than the iPhone's (480 x 320) and more precise (works with its pen or with fingers). Second, it's clear enough to not strain your eyes. Third, it's actual resolution is good enoug to make large applications like AbiWord or OpenOffice fit on screen (thanks to the <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?p=199639#post199639">Debian environment you can install</a>).</p>

<p>Another thing I appreciate is how you can use it to both download and listen to a podcast or videocast without the need to "sync" it with a computer. Can't both the iPod touch and Zune now do it since they both have wifi, or are they still too dumb to do it?</p>
