<p>As part of my "spring cleaning", and partly inspired by this "<a href="http://www.wwf.ca/events/earthhour/">Earth Hour</a>" thing, I did an inventory of all the connected electrical devices around my apartment.</p>

<p>I basically categorized them this way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Devices that are used all the time and must be connected: Lights, electrical heating, fridge, water heater and so on.</li>
<li>Devices that are seldom used, but cannot be turned off completely or disconnected easily: Oven, washer, dryer, and so on.</li>
<li>Devices that are on all the time, for some reason.</li>
<li>Devices that are used enough to warrant leaving them in "low-power standby mode".</li>
<li>Devices I should turn off completely or disconnect when not used.</li>
</ol>

<p>While I can't do anything for the devices in categories 1 and 2, other than replacing them, my goal was to move as many devices to either standby or turned off as possible. For example, my "home server PC", a Mac mini, doesn't use much power, but do I really need to have to running all the time? So I programmed it to be in standby, and wake up only during the afternoons on weekdays.</p>

<p>For devices already in standby mode, are they used enough? For example, my Panasonic Blu-Ray player kept being warm, since it remained in standby mode, for what? About 10 seconds of boot time? Since my TV takes that much time to "boot up" anyway, I just need to power on both at the same time, and I'll save all the electricity of keeping it in standby all the time.</p>

<p>I am generally less worried about laptops, tables and other battery-operated mobile devices when they stand in standby. They are already quite energy-efficient, running on batteries or not, especially when not actively used. Still, unplugging them from chargers reduces risks if there's an electrical surcharge in the apartment's wiring.</p>
