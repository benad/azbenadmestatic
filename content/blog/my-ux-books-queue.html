<p>So, I’m entering into the world of usability (<em>UX</em>) and design, and for now it seems the best way to do so is to read a bunch of good books about the subject. Based on <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/story/11/10/06/1939224/Ask-Slashdot-Good-Relevant-Usability-Book">this post on Slashdot</a>, I identified four:</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum-Products/dp/0672326140/">The Inmates Are Running the Asulum</a> by Alan Cooper. This seems more <em>meta</em>, meaning why so many of our product’s design suck, and integrating good design practices in for-profit corporations.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Humane-Interface-Directions-Designing-Interactive/dp/0201379376/">The Humane Interface</a> by Jef Raskin, who had a great influence in the Macintosh in the 80s.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/">Don’t Make Me Think</a> by Steve Krug. This book is more focused on web site usability and their economics.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Interfaces-ebook/dp/B004GTLFH8/">Designing Interfaces</a> by Jenifer Tidwel. This is a more pragmatic book that presents many (usability) design patterns.</li>
</ul><p>All of these are available as e-books <em>except</em> for Raskin’s book. Luckilly, through work I have full access to <a href="http://www.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari Books Online</a>, and it just so happens that all of those four books are there, including Rsaskin’s book. I even had enough “credits” to download them as (heavily watermarked) PDF or Kindle (“mobi”). By the way, Safari Books is such an amazing service I wouldn’t mind paying the $500 / year fee.</p><p>Finally, archived recordings of Stanford Human-Computer Interaction seminars are available exclusively on iTunes U, for example the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/itunes-u/human-computer-interaction/id384230327">Winter 2010</a> seminars. Maybe instead I should start with the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/itunes-u/human-computer-interaction/id559588768">Spring 2012</a> one and work backwards from there. Either way it’s completely free.</p><p>With all that, I should be set for the next few months. After that, I may have to expand to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_psychology">educational psychology</a>...</p>
