<p>If you <a href="http://www.google.com/">google</a> me long enough, you'll notice last year I had two blogs: <a href="http://slashdot.org/~benad/journal/">one on Slashdot</a>, with tech stuff, and one <a href="http://benad.livejournal.com/">right here</a>, with more day-to-day stuff. Two blogs at the same time was too much so I stopped both.
<p/>
But <i>now</i> I have too much programming stuff to talk about, so I'm starting this again.
<p/>
I'll be talking mostly about software development, and related subjects. Right now I'm really in Java development, but I'll talk about other languages too.
<p/>
Oh, and I will <i>not</i> talk about work!</p>
