<p>As I extolled <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2012/7/6/synchronization-nightmares.html">yesterday</a> the virtues of online syncing services, you may question the wisdom of storing all that personal information online purely for the convenience of automatic data synchronization across devices. But then, there is even <em>creepier</em> ways online services can track you, and somehow users actually willingly opt in those services.</p>

<p>What I'm talking about are tracking services, namely Google Latitude and Find My Friends by Apple. The idea is simple: Your cellphone constantly tracks your approximate location, and to a select few friends you let the the ability to find your location. It is often marketed as "let's find where my buddies are so I can hang out with them", though honestly this is pretty creepy or annoying (depending on how creepy are your acquaintances). The other, far more reasonable, is for parents to track their kids' location, though after a certain age using that still may be showing a lack of trust.</p>

<p>The only way I can see that working is to only let very trusted, very close people to you let see your location, for emergency reasons, or simply because in the hectic every day lives it can help coordinate picking up kinds, groceries, and so on. That makes sense, but then again, it's a lot of trust towards Google or Apple for something that could be resolved with a simple "w r u?" text message.</p>

<p>Come back in a few years when I break down how pointless is Google Glasses.</p>
