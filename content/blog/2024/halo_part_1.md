In early 2020, when I saw that that "[Halo: The Master Chief Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_The_Master_Chief_Collection)" was available with my [Xbox Game Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Pass) subscription that I had on my PC, I thought it might have been the time to try out this whole "[Halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(franchise))" game thing before [Halo Infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_Infinite) is released.

Before that, some context as to why I actively avoided playing any Halo games during so many years.

My introduction to computers and software development was on the [Macintosh computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_%28computer%29), and so that's also where I played with my computer games. The number of games available on the Mac was quite limited compared to PCs, and even fewer "Mac exclusive games" were available.

The [Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_%28video_game%29) game by Bungie was one of those exclusives.
