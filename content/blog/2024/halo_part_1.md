In early 2020, when I saw that that "[Halo: The Master Chief Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_The_Master_Chief_Collection)" was available with my [Xbox Game Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Pass) subscription that I had on my PC, I thought it might have been the time to try out this whole "[Halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(franchise))" game thing before [Halo Infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_Infinite) is released.

Before that, some context as to why I actively avoided playing any Halo games during so many years.

My introduction to computers and software development was on the [Macintosh computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_%28computer%29), and so that's also where I played with my computer games. The number of games available on the Mac was quite limited compared to PCs, and even fewer "Mac exclusive games" were available.

The [Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_%28video_game%29) game by Bungie was one of those exclusives. It was a First Person Shooter for the Mac released in December 1994, a year after DOOM, which wouldn't be available on the Mac until summer 1995. Its sequel, "Marathon 2: Durandal", released in November 1995, was first released for Mac, but also got eventually ported to PC and even the [Pippin console](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin). Nowadays, it is available on the [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/games/store/marathon-durandal/bnqlqblkr2mn) while [Classic Marathon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398450/Classic_Marathon/) is now on Steam. The final sequel, [Marathon Infinity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_Infinity), was bundled with the map editor named "Forge".

In 1999, the Marathon 2 engine was open sourced, named [Aleph One](https://alephone.lhowon.org/). A year later I contributed to that project by enabling a few multiplayer modes that were left half-implemented in its code. It was my first open source project contribution; You can find my notes in the project here: [Benad_Netgame_Docs/Read Me](https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/blob/master/docs/Benad_Netgame_Docs/Read%20Me).

***TODO***

Terminals, skulls, Forge, etc. Maybe even the "infinite" title?
