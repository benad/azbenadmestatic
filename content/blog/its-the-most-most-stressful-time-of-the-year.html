<p>And so we're now in the most stressful time of the year. It's getting cold, so it's easier for me to get sick, work is kind of in a rush right now, and to top it off I have to buy lots and lots of presents.</p>

<p>Shopping in other times is stressful enough, so compound that with the time pressure <em>and</em> having to be pressured to find out what would be an appropriate gift for each person is a big ordeal.</p>

<p>This year, though, I booked off two weeks of vacation, the last week of December to the first week of January, so I'll have the time to recover from the physical and mental crash I may experience by the end of next week. Why couldn't Christmas be during the summer like in the southern hemisphere?</p>
