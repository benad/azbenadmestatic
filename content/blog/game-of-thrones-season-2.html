<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I&rsquo;ve recently seen the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOzXsqoJhtE">trailer of Game of Thrones Season 2</a> on YouTube, which should roughly correspond to the book &ldquo;A Clash of King&rdquo;, book two of the &ldquo;A Song of Ice and Fire&rdquo; series by George R. R. Martin. The first season was an incredibly well made adaptation of the book, and hopefully the second season will be just as good.</p>  <p>I still haven&rsquo;t finished reading the second book, so I was relieved that the trailer didn&rsquo;t spoil too much the story. I just hope I&rsquo;ll have the time to finish reading it by the time the season starts on April first, but I really tend to procrastinate too much when reading long books. I suspect I&rsquo;ll have to read it on my iPhone rather than listening to audio books to place me in the mood of finishing it soon, as my list of books I was to read is now becoming long.</p></div>
