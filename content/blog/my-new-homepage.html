<p>Well, I got fed up of writing my <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/benad/">home page</a> in super clean XHTML strict that has cool JavaScript, yet gracefully falls back on older browsers and such. So I just built up everything using <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a>, a good looking template and some plugins, and that's it.</p>
<p>Why did I focus so much about the technical aspect, when in the end the users will only notice it looks ugly and the content is missing? At least now I have something I won't be ashamed showing to others, even if it is slightly glitchy on Safari or other more obscure browsers...</p>
