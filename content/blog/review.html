<p>How long should I wait before I can review my own programming as objectively as possible? Or should I simply hope for bad memory?</p>

<p>The same can be said for my prose. While I rarely review my blog posts after their posting, I <em>should</em> be reviewing the articles I write on <a href="http://benad.me/articles.xml">my web site</a>. An example from the <a href="http://benad.me/software_design.xml">Software Design article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another indirect effect of a simpler language is that by hand-picking only a few software design patterns syntactically available in the language you can push developers consistently <em>towers</em> certain best practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can almost feel my brain&#8217;s &#8220;autocomplete&#8221; in its way of moving my typing fingers when I wrote <em>towards</em> as <em>towers</em>. How could I have not <em>seen</em> that mistake?</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> review my emails before sending, for work or otherwise, so why is it that when my writing is more creative, like programming or those thick articles or mine, I flat out write myself I to exhaustion, and then simply procrastinate the review of what I wrote? Do I need an editor, or peer programming?</p>
