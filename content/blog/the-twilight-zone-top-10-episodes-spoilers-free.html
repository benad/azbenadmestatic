<p>Last week, I discovered that I now have access (legally) to the 1960s series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_%281959_TV_series%29">The Twilight Zone</a>, just in time for this "Halloween month". Unwilling to watch all 5 seasons, I looked online for the "best 10 episodes". Doing so was problematic, and risky for those like me that are new to the series.</p>

<p>First, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Twilight_Zone_episodes">156 episodes</a>, so it isn't likely that you'll get a good consensus on what is the best ten. The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052520/eprate">IMDB episode ratings</a> may be the closest thing to a consensus, but it's unlikely that everybody that rated episodes watched the full series. Looking at individual top-10 lists, personal preference in the kind of episode they prefer also creates a bias.</p>

<p>Second, though it's not that much of a big problem, is that most of those top-10 lists mention only the episode titles, not their number (season and episode-of-season number). I don't want to scan through the full 156 episode list to find a matching title each time I want to watch an episode.</p>

<p>Finally, and the biggest issue, is that most of those lists not only list the episode titles, but also a description of what happened in the episode, and sometimes even a screenshot of the episode that spoils the whole twist.</p>

<p>So I went through ten of those lists, giving more weight to the IMDB one, and here's the result. No spoilers, just the title and episode numbers.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Eye of the Beholder S02E06</li>
<li>Time Enough at Last S01E08</li>
<li>It's a Good Life S03E08</li>
<li>The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street S01E22</li>
<li>Nightmare at 20,000 Feet S05E03</li>
<li>To Serve Man S03E24</li>
<li>Walking Distance S01E05</li>
<li>Living Doll S05E06</li>
<li>The Invaders S02E15</li>
<li>Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up? S02E28</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice that none on these are part of season 4, which had hour-long episodes rather than 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Also, a few honourable mentions that showed up high enough is many lists.</p>

<ol>
<li>A Stop at Willoughby S01E30</li>
<li>The Hitch-Hiker S01E16</li>
<li>Five Characters in Search of an Exit S03E14</li>
<li>Twenty-Two S02E17</li>
<li>Long-Distance Call S02E22</li>
<li>Nick of Time S02E07</li>
<li>The Obsolete Man S02E29</li>
<li>The Masks S05E25</li>
</ol>
