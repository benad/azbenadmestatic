<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Who said that RSS is dead? Given the deluge of news in the tech world, with my busy schedule it&rsquo;s difficult to be up-to-date, even with the <a href="http://benad-blog.posterous.com/catching-up-on-ces">podcasts I listen to</a>. So, I broke down my news sources in 3 sections: important low-volume, medium, and noise.</p>  <p>For the important stuff, I mostly subscribe using <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> to a bunch of RSS feeds that tend to be seldom ly updated. I use use <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> as my main interface to Google Reader, though at times I use Google&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>I also keep medium-priority stuff in Reader too, though for these I end up using <a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> or <a href="http://www.pulse.me/">Pulse</a> on my iPad or iPhone for casual reading. Interesting reads are saved to my <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> account, which transfers to my Amazon Kindle every week as some kind of simple magazine.</p>  <p>Finally, for noise, I simply use Twitter. Yeah, I could subscribe to a few Twitter feeds in Google Reader, but that&rsquo;d be overkill.</p></div>
