<p><em>This is part 5 of 12 of my retrospective of Stanley Kubrickâ€™s career.</em></p>

<p>"Peace is our profession".</p>

<p>So I watched "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/">Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worring and Love the Bomb</a>", but this time on my new Blu-ray set. The image quality didn't gain much, and I selected the stereo track rather than the overkill 5.1 HD audio. So, about the movie itself.</p>

<p>Based on a slightly paranoid "what if" book "Red Alert" about nuclear armement in the 60s, this is a dark yet somewhat realistic movie about the absurdity of the nuclear race during the cold war. And the comedy works both in making us laugh and think.</p>

<p>As usual, Kubrick's sets and costumes are incredibly intricate and realistic. As with Paths of Glory, the small-scale battle scenes are intense and have excellent pacing. Peter Sellers' 3 roles are strikingly different and riveting. Also, there's even the appearance of a young James Erl Jones. The movie ended up being quite influential. The idea of a "war room" actually came from that movie.</p>

<p>So, yes, a short dark comedy that all of us can enjoy in the calm 60 years later.</p>
