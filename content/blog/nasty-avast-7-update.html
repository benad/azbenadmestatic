<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>Last Saturday, my copy of <a href="http://www.avast.com/">Avast Internet Security</a> silently updated, for free, from version 6 to version 7. To my surprise, today all my emails I got at work were being marked as &ldquo;spam&rdquo;, no matter how much I marked each and every of these as &ldquo;not spam&rdquo; and whitelisted my own domain.</p>  <p>So I went through the process on fully uninstalling and reinstalling Avast by rebooting (without network) in safe mode, running their special Avast remover software, and reinstalling the full version using their offline installer. That fixed the &ldquo;spamming&rdquo; problem, but then the &ldquo;mail filtering&rdquo; real-time scanning module could not be turned on anymore, even after clicking the &ldquo;Fix This&rdquo; button the the main status page. So, there I went again at another uninstall/install loop, but this time using the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; uninstallation process, and at last that fixed everything.</p>  <p>The lesson is, on major version updates, a full uninstall and install (using the normal process) is the best approach at fixing things. At least rebooting when you have a fast SSD doesn&rsquo;t take too much time.</p></div>
