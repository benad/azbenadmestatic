<div class='posterous_autopost'>Today I wasn't sure if I'd be able to post anything. First, my Internet connection slowed down to a halt (well, I still had the normal 3Mbps upstream, but downstream I could barely get 0.5Mbps). Also, Posterous was down for a few hours today ( <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/posterous/status/158266563584196608">https://twitter.com/#!/posterous/status/158266563584196608</a> ), which may explain yesterday why my post's email seem to have been ignored, forcing me to manually post through the rather limited Posterous app for iOS. <p /> This reminded me how much I enjoy Opera Mini on my phone ( <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">http://www.opera.com/mobile/</a> ) and even its desktop version when bandwidth is severely limited. Before I upgraded to a proper (6 GB per month) phone data plan, I used to have only 50 MB per month. Yet, with Opera Mini installed on my unlocked RIZR Z8 phone, I could stay connected without too much issue. Text-only mind you, but with Opera Mini's amazing compression it wasn't a problem. I didn't mind much privacy-wise about the fact that this worked because the "real" browser was running on Opera's server since I never used it for anything too personal. I still use Opera Mini from time to time on both my iPhone and iPad, when my Internet connection sucks (like today), or when I want to read some graphics-intensive web site like The Verge. <p /> Apart from that, I finished the day listening to Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack for Star Trek: The Motion Picture. While I do not particularly enjoy Star Trek, the filler music used to accompany those interminable scenes are so good that the first time I saw the movie I didn't mind those "intermissions" that much. I fully understand why they reused the movie's theme for the entire Next Generation's series.</div>
