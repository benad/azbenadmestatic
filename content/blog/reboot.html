<div class='posterous_autopost'>Another year, another wave of resolutions that will be broken within a month...<p />In my case, I see that as an opportunity to embark on some short-term project that will practice my neglected writing skills. I&#039;d often embark on writing a lengthy document for my web site (<a href="http://benad.me/">http://benad.me/</a>) just to let it sit there for months, because A: the article deals with such &quot;deep&quot; matter that writing every sentence is painfully difficult, and B: because I don&#039;t want to publish it until it is complete. Combined, that created an environment where simply not writing at all was all too easy.<p /> All the while, I see those countless blogs (now on tumblr, a new fad I guess), that while mostly vapid are still updated more than once per day. Hey, I can do that!<p />So I have this crazy idea: I&#039;m going to update my blog every day for a year. With careful planning, this should be relatively easy. That&#039;s why for now I focus on writing in plain text through an email interface on Posterous. Does that mean that I&#039;ll have to get Internet access of some kind for each day next year? Yes, and my process will take that into account. What about the content of my posts? Well, similar to years before I&#039;ll write on programming and technology, but this time I&#039;ll also write up some reviews of books, movies and music. Also I&#039;ll make sure my writings can reach a wider audience, though for sure ill sometimes &quot;geek out&quot; when writing about programming.<p /> Enough for today. I&#039;ll go on in more detail tomorrow about my process and what tools I&#039;ll be using to make one post a day.</div>
