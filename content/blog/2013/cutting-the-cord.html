<p>Today, I've "cut the cord" of cable. Litterally. With cissors. For some reason, they used some kind of security bracket thing on their cable modem, and they instructed me to actually cut the cable wire a foot below it. I also don't have a landline phone anymore. I now have only DSL Internet access and a cellphone. Apart from my ridiculously outdated voice plan (100 minutes, compensated by a 6 GB data plan), I'm now connected only with Internet connections.</p>

<p>It's not like I'm going to miss cable TV, as I previously mentioned <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2012/6/21/on-demand-tv-channels.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.benad.me/blog/2012/11/24/tv-ads">here</a>. And it's not like I'm saving that much money. Yet, it's for the principle that I shouldn't pay for something I haven't used in over half a year.</p>

<p>More than these, it's not paying a cent anymore to this incestuous duopoly of Bell and Quebecor. Both have managed to siphon off all media in Québec so thoroughly and cheaply that they make Radio-Canada's propaganda <em>almost</em> acceptable compared to the rampant corporatism of the duopoly. Having seen my popular culture turned into government or corporate ass-kissing, no wonder why I don't bother with anything that's not "indie", be it made in Québec or anywhere else. The contrast between our artists' talent and the sheer cheapness of our local corporate media speaks volume. At least in the past TV was <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A9taine"><em>kétaine</em></a> ( <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;prev=_dd&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffr.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FK%25C3%25A9taine">English</a> ) yet sincere, now they're just cheap liars.</p>

<p>All that is now a thing of the past. My TV is now simply a screen to the vast world of Internet video, and that's more than enough.</p>
