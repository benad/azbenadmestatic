<p>I wanted to use some of my vacation time to research on <a href="https://beansbinding.dev.java.net/">Beans Binding (JSR 295)</a>, its effect on the Model-View-Controler, and if there are other implementations of a similar "data syncronization" pattern elsewhere, but... I was on vacation for two weeks, so I spent most of my time resting (semi-comatose). Instead, here's what I learned during that time:</p>

<p>&bull;&nbsp;Seasons 9 and 10 of <a href="http://stargate.mgm.com/sg1/">Stargate SG-1</a> is really a spin-off of its own compared to season 1 to 8. While much of the main cast changed, the writing was pretty good, especially in season 10. The follow-up movie "The Ark of Truth" is kind of a season 11 condensed in 2 episodes, so the writing feels weird and rushed.</p>

<p>&bull;&nbsp;The Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">AirPort Express</a> doesn't work too well with the <a href="http://fixppp.org/">Tomato/MLPPP firmware</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Distribution_System">WDS</a>. But then, we used only the AirPort Express for its USB printer sharing, and our printer is a network printer that can connect directly to the router.</p>

<p>&bull;&nbsp;While the <a href="http://wiibrew.org/wiki/MPlayer">port</a> by Team Twiizers of <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">MPlayer</a> for the Nintendo Wii supports DVD playing and has a great user interface, <a href="http://wiibrew.org/wiki/MPlayerWii">MPlayerWii</a> supports external USB flash drives.</p>

<p>&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/home/939732.html">Geometry Wars: Galaxies</a> is easier on the DS than on the Wii because of framerate issues, but for extra challenge try playing it on the bus while standing up.</p>

<p>&bull;&nbsp;Oh, and it's <tt>&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;</tt></p>
