<p>After <a href="http://status.twitter.com/">reading about</a> all those issues about <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>, I wondered why their messaging backend wasn't simply using email. Every user has both an email address and a mailing list that allows only its owner to post a new message. Following a user is to simply subscribe to that user's mailing list. And so on.</p>
<p>Email is quite scalable, so for twitter's backend that would work well. The rest (web pages, accounts, etc.) can be done with a distributed MySQL cluster, as usual.</p>
<p>... Or am I missing something?</p>
