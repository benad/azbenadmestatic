<p>Back at school I had to learn to make UML diagrams and such, and it was a pretty bad experience. We had to use Rational Rose (now owned by IBM, I think), and not only it was super expensive, but it was buggy. <i>Very</i> buggy. Worse than any Microsoft product.</p>

<p>Now, almost 6 years later, I download <a href="http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/javatools/jsenterprise/tpr/index.html">NetBeans 5.5 Preview</a> and play with it a little bit. It has round-trip UML diagrams, that is <b>you draw class diagrams and such and you get code</b>. A "design center" that generates GoF patters on pre-existing classes. And I won't even start talking about the <b>XML schema editor</b> that can generate HTML documentation and display usage diagrams on-the-fly.</p>

<p>And let me just completely ignore all those server-side thingies like the integrated Sun Java System Application Server, the <a href="http://developers.sun.com/prodtech/javatools/jsenterprise/tpr/reference/docs/bpel_gsg.html">BPEL</a> state machine thing to integrate web services, and the built-in Apache Derby database, of course.</p>

<p>... I'll come back with a better review later. For now I'll have to catch my breath...</p>
