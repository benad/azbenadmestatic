            <p>So, why the nickname "Benad"? Well, to explain that, I first need
            to start with the ethymology of my real name, Benoit
            Nadeau.</p>
        </section>
        <section title="Benoit Nadeau">
            <p>My first and last name are unusual. Yes,
            here in Québec, both the given name "Benoit" and the surname
            "Nadeau" are quite usual.</p>
            <p>To put things in context, in Québec many women would simply
            keep their surname after marriage, which would save paperwork
            and confusion after divorce. To avoid "sexism", or fights,
            parents would often would give <i>both</i> their unchanged
            surnames to their kids. Of course, the order of such compound
            surname could be the source of a fight too, and no one properly
            thought ahead of what would happen in the next generation.</p>
            <p>So, for me, I got my mother's surname, "Benoit", and my
            father's surname "Nadeau". And since "Benoit" can be both a
            surname and given name, it became my given name. Don't worry,
            my sibblings only got "Nadeau" as surnames, keeping a bit of
            "tradition"...</p>
        </section>
        <section title="The Circumflex Accent">
            <p>But then, I'm not totally forthcoming about my name.
            Officially, my name is "BENOIT JEAN LOUIS-OLIVIER NADEAU",
            written with a cheap typewriter at the mayor's office. Years
            later, that was "translated" officially to "Benoît Jean
            Louis-Olivier Nadeau". Notice that circumflex accent (the accent
            "^") on the "i" that just appeared out of nowhere.</p>
            <p>Well, I personally don't care about the circumflex accent,
            even though officially I was given one by the
            government. Why? Well, a bit of ethymology about the name "Benoit".
            </p>
            <p>"Benoit" is an old Latin name that dates back to the 13th
            century, from the word "benedictus", or "blessed". Its original
            French form was "Benoist", which sounds like "buh-no-east".
            Later, the "s" became silent, so it sounded like "buh-no-it". To
            separate the vowels "o" and "i" in the sound, a circumflex
            accent was added on the "i". In modern French though the name
            now sounds like "be-n-wa", so eventually the accent will be
            dropped altogether, but depending of use (given versus surname,
            lineage, region, etc.) the accent remains. And that's what
            the government "guessed".</p>
            <p>So, let me be clear: officially it's "Benoît", usually it's
            "Benoit", and it sounds like "be-n-wa". And I quickly learned
            from Anglophones that have no knowledge of French that they would
            almost always say "ben-oy-t", which sounds horrible, so I had
            to do <i>something</i>...</p>
        </section>
        <section title="Benad">
            <p>The "compromise" for Anglophones in the form of "Benad" came
            as an unintended consequence of me trying to figure out what my
            Internet nickname should be.</p>
            <p>It was still the early 90s when I realized of the importance
            of the name you give to yourself for your "main" online
            personality. More than that, I forsaw that finding a unique
            name would just be harder over time as everybody became more
            "connected".</p>
            <p>So, I connected the first three letters of my given name to
            the first three letters of my surname. And it sounded good in
            English. So I kept it.</p>
            <p>Well, it's still not totally unique since "Benad" is a real
            given name. But if I'm lucky enough, nobody registered it before I
            do.</p>
            <p>And what about the "84" I add when somebody else already
            registered "benad"? No, it's not my birth year (I wish). It's
            because the novel "1984" was one of the first English novel I've
            read, so I kept using "84" as a suffix.</p>
